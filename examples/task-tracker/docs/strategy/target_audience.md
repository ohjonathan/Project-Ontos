# Target Audience

## Primary: Solo Developers

- Side project builders juggling multiple ideas
- Freelancers managing 2-3 clients simultaneously
- Students balancing coursework + personal projects

## What They Currently Use (and Hate)

| Tool | Problem |
|------|---------|
| Jira | Too heavy, designed for teams of 50 |
| Notion | Too flexible, becomes a mess within weeks |
| Todoist | Too focused on personal life, not dev work |
| Sticky notes | No search, no sync, falls off monitor |

## What They Actually Want

- Dump tasks fast (capture the thought before it's gone)
- Find tasks faster (fuzzy search, not folder hierarchies)
- Never think about "project management" as a separate activity

## Anti-Audience

We are NOT building for:
- Teams (use Linear, Jira, Asana)
- GTD enthusiasts (use OmniFocus, Things)
- People who enjoy customizing their productivity system
