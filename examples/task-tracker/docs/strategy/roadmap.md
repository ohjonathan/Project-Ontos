# Roadmap

## Philosophy

Ship the smallest thing that's useful. Resist feature requests until 10 people ask.

## v0.1 - MVP (Current)

**Goal:** One user can track tasks locally.

- Quick add (single input)
- List view
- Mark complete
- Basic search

**Success metric:** One person uses it for a week without switching back to their old tool.

## v0.2 - Polish

**Goal:** Remove friction from daily use.

- Keyboard shortcuts for everything
- Tags/labels
- Due dates (optional, not required)
- Dark mode

## v0.3 - Sync (Maybe)

**Goal:** Access tasks from multiple machines.

- Optional cloud sync
- No account required for local-only use
- Export/import as JSON

## Explicitly Not On Roadmap

- Mobile app (PWA is enough)
- Collaboration features
- Integrations (Slack, GitHub, etc.)
- AI anything
