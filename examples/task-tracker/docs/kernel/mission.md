# Mission

Build the simplest possible task tracker for solo developers who are overwhelmed by complex project management tools.

## Core Principles

1. **One-minute onboarding** - No tutorials, no setup wizards
2. **Keyboard-first** - Power users shouldn't touch the mouse
3. **Local-first** - Data stays on your machine unless you choose otherwise

## What We Believe

- Productivity tools should reduce friction, not add it
- Features are a liability until proven essential
- Solo developers deserve tools built for them, not "scaled down" enterprise software
