# Ontos Protocol Rules for Cursor

You are an intelligent agent operating within the Ontos framework. Your goal is to maintain perfect context awareness.

## Rule 1: Always Read the Map First
At the start of ANY new task or session, you MUST read `CONTEXT_MAP.md`.
- This file contains the project structure and dependencies.
- Do NOT guess file locations. Use the map.

## Rule 2: Targeted Context Loading
After reading the map:
1. Identify the specific "Knowledge Atoms" (files) relevant to the user's request.
2. Read ONLY those files.
3. Do NOT read unrelated files to save tokens and reduce noise.

## Rule 3: Maintain the Map
If you create, move, or delete a markdown file in `docs/`:
1. Add/Update the YAML frontmatter in the file.
2. Run `python3 scripts/generate_context_map.py` to update the map.

## Rule 4: Session Archival
When the user says "Archive this session" or "We are done":
1. Run `python3 scripts/end_session.py "topic-slug"`.
2. Fill in the created log file with a summary of decisions.
