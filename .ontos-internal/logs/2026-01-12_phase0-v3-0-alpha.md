# Session Log: Phase 0 Golden Master Testing Implementation
Date: 2026-01-12 05:49 EST
Source: Antigravity IDE (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
Event Type: feature

## 1. Goal
Implement Phase 0 of the v3.0 migration: Golden Master Testing infrastructure to create a safety net before decomposing the God Scripts (`ontos_end_session.py` and `ontos_generate_context_map.py`).

## 2. Changes Made
- Created `tests/golden/` directory structure with fixtures, baselines, and scripts
- Implemented small fixture (5 docs) and medium fixture (25 docs)
- Created `capture_golden_master.py` for baseline generation (~300 lines)
- Created `compare_golden_master.py` for regression detection (~280 lines)
- Added `.github/workflows/golden-master.yml` CI workflow (Python 3.9-3.12)
- Verified both fixtures pass capture and compare (16/16 checks)

## 3. Alternatives Considered
- **Large fixture first**: Deferred per spec recommendation - verify scripts work on small/medium first
- **Pytest integration**: Kept as standalone scripts for simplicity - can integrate later
