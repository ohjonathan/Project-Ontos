# Project Ontos: Strategic Analysis Codex

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Ontos Version:** 3.0.2
**Generated By:** Claude Opus 4.5

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Project Ontos is a **local-first documentation management system** designed to eliminate "context death" in AI-assisted software development. It transforms project documentation into a **portable knowledge graph** that any AI agent can read, ensuring that project context survives tool migrations, chat resets, and team changes.

**Core Value Proposition:** "Never explain your project twice."

**Key Differentiator:** Space-Time Ontology — a dual-axis knowledge structure that separates current truth (Space) from historical decisions (Time), enabling both "what is" and "why" queries.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Core Problem: Context Is Not Portable

Every time you switch AI tools, start a new chat, or hand off a project, you lose the "why" behind your code. Hours are spent re-explaining architecture, product decisions, and constraints to each new blank slate.

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **AI Amnesia** | You explain architecture to Claude, then to ChatGPT, then to Cursor. Each starts from zero. |
| **Prototype Graveyards** | You build fast, make dozens of decisions, then rewrite. The code is new; the decisions are lost in old chat logs. |
| **Tribal Knowledge** | Your project's "why" lives in Slack threads, abandoned docs, and people's heads. New collaborators must rediscover everything. |

### 2.2 Target Users

**Primary: Small Teams Using AI Coding Agents**
- 1-5 developers working with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or similar
- Building products where decisions matter more than code volume
- Onboarding new team members constantly (contractors, new hires, AI agents)

**Secondary: Solo Developers with Multiple Projects**
- Juggling 2-5 projects simultaneously
- Returning to projects after weeks of dormancy
- Frustrated by re-explaining context to every AI session

**Anti-Audience:**
- Large enterprises with dedicated doc teams
- Real-time collaboration use cases
- People who want zero maintenance

### 2.3 Why Alternatives Fail

| Alternative | Why It Fails |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Wiki/Confluence** | Separate from code, stale within weeks, requires active maintenance culture |
| **Git History** | Captures "what" not "why", commits are too granular for understanding |
| **RAG/Vector Search** | Probabilistic retrieval, can't guarantee relevant context, noise compounds |
| **Manual Markdown** | No structure, no validation, no discoverability, decays quickly |
| **README.md** | Single entry point, can't capture relationships or evolution |

---

## 3. Market Fit Analysis

### 3.1 User Personas

**The AI Solopreneur**
- Solo founder shipping 2-3 products
- Heavy AI tool user (Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT)
- Pain: "I spent 30 minutes re-explaining my auth flow to Claude after context compaction"
- Gain: "I type 'Activate Ontos' and the AI knows everything about my project"

**The Small Team Lead**
- Managing 2-4 developers with high contractor turnover
- Ships fast, documents rarely
- Pain: "Every new contractor takes a week to understand why we built things this way"
- Gain: "New people clone the repo and are productive on day one"

### 3.2 Competitive Landscape

| Tool | Approach | Weakness |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Notion/Confluence** | Central wiki | Separate from code, stale quickly |
| **RAG tools** | Vector embeddings | Probabilistic, no structure, noise |
| **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)** | Decision logs | No dependency graph, manual linking |
| **Claude Projects** | Conversation history | Vendor-locked, not portable |
| **MCP Context Servers** | Protocol-based context | Requires server setup, not local-first |

### 3.3 Differentiation: The Space-Time Ontology

Ontos's unique contribution is the **dual ontology** that separates two fundamental dimensions of project knowledge:

| Dimension | Question | Mechanism | Example Query |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Space** | What IS true? | `depends_on` graph | "What does auth depend on?" |
| **Time** | What HAPPENED? | `impacts` links from logs | "Why did auth change?" |

This enables AI agents to navigate your project's knowledge graph deterministically, not probabilistically.

---

## 4. Value Propositions

### 4.1 Primary Value Proposition

> **"Never explain your project twice."**
>
> Clone the repo. Activate Ontos. Instant shared brain.

### 4.2 Before/After Scenarios

**Scenario: New Developer Onboarding**

| Before Ontos | After Ontos |
|--------------|-------------|
| Clone repo, ask Claude "How does auth work?" | Clone repo, type "Activate Ontos" |
| Claude guesses based on code structure | Claude loads context map, auth docs, and decision logs |
| Developer spends a week rediscovering context | Developer is productive in 10 minutes |

**Scenario: Returning to a Dormant Project**

| Before Ontos | After Ontos |
|--------------|-------------|
| Open project after 2 months | Open project after 2 months |
| "What was I working on? Why did I build it this way?" | Read `Ontos_Context_Map.md` |
| Spend hours re-reading code and old chats | Session logs show exactly what happened and why |

**Scenario: AI Tool Migration**

| Before Ontos | After Ontos |
|--------------|-------------|
| Migrate from Claude to Cursor | Migrate from Claude to Cursor |
| Re-explain entire architecture to new tool | Both tools read the same context map |
| Context trapped in old chat history | Context travels with the repo |

## 6. Conceptual Design Philosophy

### 6.1 The Space-Time Ontology

Project knowledge exists in two orthogonal dimensions:

**Space (The Truth Graph)**
- Answers: "What IS the system?"
- Changes: Through deliberate updates
- Structure: Acyclic dependency graph (DAG)
- Field: `depends_on`

**Time (The History Timeline)**
- Answers: "What HAPPENED?"
- Changes: Through accumulation
- Structure: Linear timeline of sessions
- Field: `impacts`

```
SPACE (Truth)                           TIME (History)
├── kernel (rank 0)                     ├── log_t1 → impacts [doc_a]
│   └── mission, philosophy             ├── log_t2 → impacts [doc_b, doc_c]
├── strategy (rank 1)                   └── log_t3 → impacts [doc_a]
│   └── depends_on: [kernel]
├── product (rank 2)
│   └── depends_on: [kernel, strategy]
└── atom (rank 3)
    └── depends_on: [kernel, strategy, product, atom]
```

### 6.2 Document Hierarchy

| Type | Rank | Purpose | Example |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| **kernel** | 0 | Foundational principles | mission.md, philosophy.md |
| **strategy** | 1 | Goals and direction | v3_roadmap.md, market_fit.md |
| **product** | 2 | User-facing specifications | auth_flow.md, dashboard_spec.md |
| **atom** | 3 | Technical implementation | oauth_impl.md, api_schema.md |
| **log** | 4 | Temporal session records | 2026-01-15_feature_auth.md |

**Dependency Rules:**
- Higher-rank documents can only depend on equal or lower ranks
- This prevents cycles by construction
- Logs never participate in `depends_on` — they use `impacts` instead

### 6.3 Curation vs Ceremony

Ontos demands **curation** (human judgment) but eliminates **ceremony** (mechanical busywork):

| Curation (We Want) | Ceremony (We Eliminate) |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| "This session matters" | Typing YAML by hand |
| "This doc impacts the API spec" | Running scripts manually |
| "We chose OAuth because..." | Formatting frontmatter |
| "This is ready for review" | Generating context maps |

**The Librarian's Wager:** Trade intentional curation effort for deterministic, high-signal context.

## 7. Mechanism Ontology

### 7.1 Core Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Repository** | A git repo with Ontos-managed documentation |
| **Context Map** | Generated `Ontos_Context_Map.md` summarizing all docs |
| **Document** | A Markdown file with YAML frontmatter |
| **Log** | A temporal record of a working session |
| **Dependency** | A `depends_on` link between documents |
| **Impact** | An `impacts` link from a log to documents it modified |

### 7.2 Three-Tier Curation Model

| Level | Name | Validation | Use Case |
|-------|------|------------|----------|
| **L0** | Scaffold | Minimal (id + type only) | Auto-generated placeholders |
| **L1** | Stub | Relaxed (type + goal) | User provides objective |
| **L2** | Full | Strict (deps + concepts) | Production-ready docs |

**Promotion Rules:**
- L0 → L1: User specifies goal/purpose
- L1 → L2: User adds dependencies + concepts
- L2 enforces `depends_on` for non-kernel/non-log types

### 7.3 Status Model

| Status | Applies To | Meaning |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **draft** | strategy, product, atom | Work in progress |
| **active** | All types | Current truth (authoritative) |
| **deprecated** | All except log | Past truth (superseded) |
| **rejected** | strategy | Considered but NOT approved |
| **complete** | strategy, atom | Finished work |
| **scaffold** | All | L0 placeholder |
| **pending_curation** | All | L1 stub |
| **archived** | log | Historical record |

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Adoption friction** | Users find curation too demanding | Progressive formalization (L0→L1→L2) |
| **Stale documentation** | Docs diverge from code | `describes` validation, staleness detection |
| **AI tool fragmentation** | Different tools need different formats | Markdown primary, `ontos agents` for tool-specific |
| **Scope creep** | Ontos tries to be everything | Clear anti-scope (no cloud, no real-time, no GUI) |
| **Maintenance burden** | Single maintainer burnout | Open source, clear contribution guidelines |

## 11. The Bet

Ontos is betting that **curated knowledge beats captured data** in AI-native workflows.

Why we think this wins:
1. **Teams need shared context** — individual memory doesn't transfer
2. **Signal degrades over time** — noise compounds; curation doesn't
3. **AI agents improve** — they'll navigate structured knowledge faster than extract signal from noise
4. **Intent forces clarity** — documenting a decision makes you understand it better

If we're right, Ontos becomes the standard way teams encode knowledge for AI-native development.

If we're wrong, we've still built a solid documentation system that works without AI.
