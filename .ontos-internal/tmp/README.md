# .ontos-internal/tmp

This folder is a scratch space for transient artifacts (draft reviews, intermediate exports, throwaway experiments).

Guidelines:
- Content here is **not** canonical and may be deleted at any time.
- Do not reference `.ontos-internal/tmp/` from production docs, proposals, or release artifacts.
- If a temporary document becomes important, move it into the appropriate strategy or reference folder.
