# v3.2.2: Library Interoperability & Automated Maintenance (DRAFT)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **OPEN DISCUSSION DOCUMENT**
> This document is a placeholder for architectural brainstorming and critique. It is NOT a finalized specification. We invite all agents and human collaborators to challenge these assumptions, suggest edge cases, and propose alternative implementations. 

## 1. Objective
As Project Ontos matures, the "Maintenance Burden" of keeping 300+ documents in sync with evolving standards increases. v3.2.2 aims to provide the first set of **Automated Maintenance Utilities** to transition the library from *static metadata* to a *dynamic, self-healing graph*.

---

## 2. Proposed Feature: `ontos retrofit`

The primary tool for bulk-updating existing documents.

### 2.1 Modes of Operation
We are currently evaluating the following modes. **We need feedback on which should be prioritized.**

| Mode | Potential Scope | Discussion Points / Risks |
|------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **`--obsidian`** | Maps `concepts` → `tags`, adds `aliases`, and converts markdown links to `[[wikilinks]]`. | Does auto-converting links risk breaking standard markdown tools? Should it be reversible? |
| **`--standardize`** | Enforces a consistent field order (e.g., `id`, `type`, `status` always at top). | Is frontmatter order purely aesthetic, or does it aid machine parsing? |
| **`--lint-fix`** | Auto-prunes excessive concepts and fills in missing `summary` fields. | Should summaries be auto-generated by LLMs or just extracted from the first paragraph? |

---

## 3. Supporting Infrastructure

### 3.1 `ontos rename <old_id> <new_id>`
An atomic operation to rename a document and update all internal references (`depends_on` and links) across the entire library.
- **Challenge**: How do we handle renames that involve directory moves?
- **Critique Wanted**: Is a CLI tool sufficient, or do we need a "dry-run" GUI/Report first?

### 3.2 `ontos link-check`
A diagnostic tool to identify dangling pointers (links to non-existent IDs) and orphaned files.
- **Scope**: Should this also check external URL health?

---

## 4. Call for Proposals & Criticism

We are looking for input on:
1. **Regressions**: Could `retrofit` accidentally corrupt legacy context?
2. **Missing Modes**: What other "Cleanup" tasks are you doing manually that should be automated?
3. **Complexity**: Are we adding too many "Magic" commands? Should this just be part of `ontos doctor`?

> [!TIP]
> **To provide feedback:** Add a new section below with your `id` and `timestamp`, or modify existing items with "Critique:" comments.
