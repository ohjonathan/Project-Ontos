# v3.0.2 Technical Debt Resolution Proposal

**Theme:** "Phase 0 Remediation & Critical Documentation Fixes"
**Status:** DRAFT
**Date:** 2026-01-18
**Author:** Gemini CLI (Powered by Gemini 2.0 Pro)

---

## 1. Overview

This proposal addresses "Phase 0" technical debt items that were identified in December 2025 but bypassed during the v3.0 pivot. These are low-effort, high-impact fixes required to ensure a professional and functional user experience for v3.0.x users.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Two critical issues remain unresolved:
1.  **Broken Uninstall Sequence:** Current documentation in `Ontos_Manual.md` instructs users to delete the `.ontos/` directory before running the `remove_frontmatter` script, which results in script failure.
2.  **Resource Confusion:** Duplicate versions of `Common_Concepts.md` exist, leading to confusion about the source of truth for project-wide tagging.

---

## 3. Proposed Actions

### 3.1 Fix Uninstall Documentation (P0)
**File:** `docs/reference/Ontos_Manual.md`

Update the "Uninstalling" section to reflect the correct dependency order:
1.  **Remove Frontmatter:** `python3 .ontos/scripts/ontos_remove_frontmatter.py --yes` (While `.ontos/` still exists).
2.  **Remove Git Hooks:** Delete hooks in `.git/hooks/`.
3.  **Cleanup Files:** Delete `.ontos/`, `ontos_init.py`, and `ontos_config.py`.

### 3.2 Consolidate Common_Concepts.md (P1)
**Action:** Delete the stub file at `docs/reference/Common_Concepts.md`.
**Rationale:** The comprehensive version at `.ontos-internal/reference/Common_Concepts.md` (or the one in `.ontos/templates/` used during init) is the correct source. Maintaining a stub in the user-facing `docs/` folder is misleading.

---

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Verify content** of both `Common_Concepts.md` files to ensure no data loss.
2.  **Apply `replace`** tool to `docs/reference/Ontos_Manual.md` to fix the uninstall steps.
3.  **Execute `rm`** on `docs/reference/Common_Concepts.md`.

---

## 5. Success Criteria

-   `Ontos_Manual.md` contains the correct, sequential instructions for uninstallation.
-   Only one version of `Common_Concepts.md` remains in the documentation/reference structure.
-   No regressions in standard functionality.
