## Part 1: Findings Verification

#### [MCP-2]: MCP Strategic Priority

**My original finding:** I identified the lack of Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration as a "high risk strategic miscalculation," arguing that Ontos risks obsolescence if it remains a "walled garden" while the industry standardizes on MCP. I recommended building a Local MCP Server.
**CA's interpretation:** "Gemini: 'high risk strategic miscalculation' to ignore MCP... 'implement now'."

| Check | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Understood correctly? | ✅ | The CA accurately captured my strategic warning about the risk of ignoring MCP. |
| Severity assessment? | ⚠️ Disagree | The CA listed severity as "N/A." I believe the severity is "Critical" strategically, but I acknowledge the "patch release" constraint makes immediate implementation impossible. |
| Scope decision? | ✅ Accept | Developing a full MCP server in a 1-2 week patch window is unrealistic. Deferring to the roadmap is the only executable decision. |
| Rationale valid? | ✅ | "Feature development is out of scope for a patch release." This is a valid semantic versioning constraint. |

**Verdict:** Accept.

#### [STR-1]: License Ambiguity

**My original finding:** I argued that the proprietary license is an "adoption bottleneck" and recommended an immediate pivot to an Open Core model (MIT/Apache 2.0 for CLI) to build trust with the "hacker" demographic.
**CA's interpretation:** "Gemini: 'Open Core immediately'."

| Check | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Understood correctly? | ✅ | CA correctly identified my recommendation. |
| Severity assessment? | ✅ Agree | CA marked this as "Strategic," which matches my view that this is a business existential issue, not a code bug. |
| Scope decision? | ✅ Accept | Licensing is a business stakeholder decision, not a technical patch task. Escalation is the correct triage action. |
| Rationale valid? | ✅ | "Business decision, not a technical bug." |

**Verdict:** Accept.

#### [STR-3]: Obsidian Frontmatter Compatibility

**My original finding:** I warned about "namespace collisions" where Ontos overwrites existing user frontmatter (tags, IDs) in tools like Obsidian. I recommended "namespaced keys" (e.g., `ontos_id`).
**CA's interpretation:** "Gemini: Ontos uses `type`, `tags`, `id` which conflict with Obsidian conventions."

| Check | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Understood correctly? | ✅ | CA correctly identified the technical conflict. |
| Severity assessment? | ✅ Agree | Rated "Medium," which is fair given it's a "good neighbor" issue rather than a functional crash. |
| Scope decision? | ✅ Accept | Changing keys (e.g., `id` -> `ontos_id`) requires a schema migration and is a breaking change. This violates the "No breaking changes" constraint for v3.0.5. |
| Rationale valid? | ✅ | "Breaking change risk." "Requires schema versioning, migration path." |

**Verdict:** Accept.

## Part 2: Decisions I Challenge

No challenges. All decisions accepted.

## Part 3: Decisions I Accept (With Notes)

| Issue ID | CA Decision | My Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP-2 | Defer to v4.0 | While I accept deferral from v3.0.5, I strongly advise accelerating this work to v3.2 or v3.5. Waiting for v4.0 risks missing the window of standardization as Agentic IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf) mature. |
| STR-3 | Defer to v3.1 | The decision to defer is correct because it requires a schema migration (breaking change). However, this work is critical for adoption among existing Obsidian users and should be P1 for v3.1. |

## Part 4: Items Not Addressed

All my findings were addressed in the triage.

## Part 5: Overall Verdict

**Triage Status:** Approved

**Summary:**
The Chief Architect correctly interpreted my strategic findings regarding MCP, Open Core licensing, and Obsidian compatibility. While I view the pivot to MCP and Open Core as urgent for the project's long-term survival, I agree they are wholly out of scope for a v3.0.5 patch release constrained to a 1-2 week timeline. The decision to escalate strategic questions to business stakeholders and defer breaking schema changes to v3.1 is procedurally sound.

**Blocking concerns:** 0
