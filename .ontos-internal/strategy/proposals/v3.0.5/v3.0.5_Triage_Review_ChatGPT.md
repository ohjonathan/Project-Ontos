## Part 1: Findings Verification

#### CFG-1: Legacy Script Config Bypass ("Two Ontos")

**My original finding:** Wrapper commands and legacy scripts behave like a separate product surface: they ignore `.ontos.toml`, which creates inconsistent behavior and breaks user trust.  
**CA's interpretation:** Valid architectural tech debt: legacy scripts read hardcoded config paths while native commands read `.ontos.toml`; not a quick fix so defer to v3.1.

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Understood correctly? | ✅ | Captured the essence: two config systems and inconsistent UX. |
| Severity assessment? | ⚠️ Disagree | Marked “Medium”; for new users this is closer to High because it creates “it works sometimes” behavior and undermines trust. |
| Scope decision? | ✅ Accept | Full fix is correctly deferred given patch constraints. |
| Rationale valid? | ✅ | It’s not a patch-sized refactor. |

**Verdict:** Accept with note

**Note for the record (non-blocking):** Even if the full fix is v3.1, v3.0.5 should mitigate user harm:  
- Add a runtime warning when wrapper commands run that they do **not** honor `.ontos.toml` yet, and point to the native equivalents.  
- Document the exact list of wrapper commands affected, not just “wrappers” as a concept.


#### WRP-1: Broken Wrapper Commands

**My original finding:** The wrapper surface is “broken enough” that users lose confidence quickly. Even partial breakage makes onboarding feel unsafe.  
**CA's interpretation:** Import/PYTHONPATH breakage was fixed in v3.0.4; remaining issues likely come from CLI arg mismatch and need targeted testing to determine true scope.

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Understood correctly? | ✅ | They differentiated “won’t start” vs “starts but behaves differently.” |
| Severity assessment? | ✅ Agree | “Medium/Partial” feels fair for a patch, assuming test results validate. |
| Scope decision? | ✅ Accept | Testing + docs is exactly right for v3.0.5. |
| Rationale valid? | ✅ | Investigation is required before changing behavior. |

**Verdict:** Accept

**Note for the record (non-blocking):** Treat wrapper testing as *user onboarding hardening*, not only QA. For each wrapper command, document: “Supported args”, “Unsupported args”, and “Native replacement (if any).”


#### UX-1: Init Installs Hooks by Default

**My original finding:** Side effects on `ontos init` are a trust killer. Even if hooks are “good”, silently changing a repo is the kind of thing that makes users uninstall.  
**CA's interpretation:** `--skip-hooks` already exists, so this is mainly a documentation/visibility issue; default hooks are intentional design.

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Understood correctly? | ❌ | My core concern was *default behavior + silent side effects*, not merely discoverability of `--skip-hooks`. |
| Severity assessment? | ⚠️ Disagree | Marked “Low”. This is one of the earliest touchpoints and can permanently shape trust. |
| Scope decision? | ⚠️ Challenge | Docs help, but they don’t remove the footgun. A small behavior tweak can be done without breaking changes. |
| Rationale valid? | ❌ | “Skip flag exists” doesn’t address the default side effect problem. |

**Verdict:** Challenge

**What was misunderstood:** The problem is not that power users can opt out. The problem is that first-time users get an unexpected repo mutation, often before they understand what Ontos is doing.  
**Correct interpretation:** Make the default experience “safe to try”. Hooks can still exist, but the act of installing them must be explicit and visible.  
**Recommended action:** Keep scope small and non-breaking:
- On `ontos init`, print a clear preflight message that hooks will be installed and where.  
- Add an interactive confirmation in TTY contexts: “Install git hooks? [Y/n]”. Default to Yes to preserve current behavior.  
- Support non-interactive mode via `--yes` and keep `--skip-hooks`.  
This preserves backwards compatibility while fixing the trust issue.


#### UX-2: Broken Commands Visible in CLI

**My original finding:** README “Known Issues” calling out broken commands is a credibility hit, especially when versions are stale.  
**CA's interpretation:** Valid. Known Issues references v3.0.3 despite v3.0.4 being released; update docs after WRP-1 testing.

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Understood correctly? | ✅ | Yes: this is primarily a trust and hygiene issue. |
| Severity assessment? | ✅ Agree | Medium is right. It directly impacts install-to-first-success. |
| Scope decision? | ✅ Accept | Updating Known Issues is a good patch deliverable. |
| Rationale valid? | ✅ | Tying it to wrapper testing is sensible. |

**Verdict:** Accept

**Note for the record (non-blocking):** Don’t just delete the warning. Replace with a precise matrix: “works / works with limitations / legacy / not supported yet” so users don’t feel misled.


#### STR-1: License Ambiguity

**My original finding:** Licensing ambiguity blocks serious adoption and contributions.  
**CA's interpretation:** Valid but strategic and out of patch scope; escalate to business stakeholders.

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Understood correctly? | ✅ | Yes. |
| Severity assessment? | ✅ Agree | It’s strategic, not a patch bug. |
| Scope decision? | ✅ Accept | Correct to keep out of v3.0.5. |
| Rationale valid? | ✅ | Business decision. |

**Verdict:** Accept


#### STR-2: Brand/Name Collision

**My original finding:** “ontos” may collide with other tooling and confuse search / discovery.  
**CA's interpretation:** Strategic marketing issue; out of patch scope.

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Understood correctly? | ✅ | Yes. |
| Severity assessment? | ✅ Agree | Strategic. |
| Scope decision? | ✅ Accept | Correct to keep out of v3.0.5. |
| Rationale valid? | ✅ | Business decision. |

**Verdict:** Accept

## Part 2: Decisions I Challenge

| Issue ID | CA Decision | My Challenge | Recommended Change |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| UX-1 | “Doc-only; severity Low” | Misunderstands the trust failure mode: default silent side effect is the issue. | Add explicit messaging + TTY confirmation. Keep defaults for backward compatibility. |


---

## Part 3: Decisions I Accept (With Notes)

| Issue ID | CA Decision | My Note |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| CFG-1 | Defer to v3.1 | Add a v3.0.5 mitigation: runtime warning + explicit docs listing which wrappers ignore `.ontos.toml`. |
| WRP-1 | Test wrappers, document limitations | Great. Treat as onboarding hardening. Publish a “supported args” matrix. |
| UX-2 | Update Known Issues | Replace vague “broken” language with precise behavior and current version references. |
| STR-1 | Escalate licensing | Fine to keep out of patch, but don’t let it stall. Put an owner + date on the decision. |
| STR-2 | Escalate naming | Fine to keep out of patch; same note: assign owner + decision date. |

## Part 4: Items Not Addressed

All my *v3.0.5-relevant* findings appear captured in the triage.

Non-blocking items I previously emphasized that are not explicitly tracked as issues here:
- **First-run “safe to try” onboarding flow** beyond hooks (interactive prompts, explicit previews, “what will change” summary). This may be intentionally out of patch scope, but it should live somewhere as a tracked v3.1+ UX initiative.
- **“Blessed surface” clarity**: a single canonical path for users, with wrappers clearly labeled as legacy/compat and not the default mental model.


---

## Part 5: Overall Verdict

**Triage Status:** Request revision

**Summary:** Most items were understood correctly and scoped appropriately for a patch release. The one material problem is UX-1: the triage treats it as a documentation issue, but it’s primarily a default-behavior trust issue. Without a small behavioral mitigation, v3.0.5 risks fixing the “symptoms” while keeping the core onboarding footgun.

**Blocking concerns:** 1
- UX-1 misunderstanding leads to an insufficient fix (docs-only) for a trust-critical first-run behavior.
