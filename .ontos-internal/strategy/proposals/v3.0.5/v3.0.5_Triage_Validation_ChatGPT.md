## Part 2: Solution Evaluation

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| Does the proposed mitigation address your concern? | Yes |
| If Partially/No, what's missing? | N/A |

**Specific checks:**

| Your Requirement | Addressed? | Notes |
|------------------|------------|-------|
| Preflight message before hook installation | ✅ | Preflight is printed before the prompt in TTY contexts. Minor note: in non-TTY contexts the spec proceeds without printing the preflight text; that’s acceptable for CI but consider a short one-line notice if you want maximum transparency. |
| TTY confirmation prompt | ✅ | Prompt `Install git hooks? [Y/n]` with default Yes. |
| Non-interactive mode support (`--yes`) | ✅ | `--yes/-y` bypasses prompt. |
| Backward compatibility preserved | ✅ | Default remains “install hooks” when user hits Enter; `--skip-hooks` remains. |

**Small consistency note (non-blocking):** The CA’s “scripts will need `--yes`” statement conflicts with the proposed logic where non-TTY proceeds without prompting. If you keep the non-TTY auto-proceed behavior, the docs should not claim `--yes` is required for scripts.
