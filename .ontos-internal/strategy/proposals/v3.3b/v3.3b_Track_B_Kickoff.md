# v3.3b Track B Kickoff

## Objective
Start Track B implementation planning on top of merged v3.3a/A1 foundations.

## Scope Anchor
Track B scope remains the settled feature set:
- Unified scan scope (`docs` default, `--scope library` opt-in)
- `ontos link-check`
- `ontos rename <old_id> <new_id>`

## Initial Inputs
Use these as the source set for Phase A spec drafting:
- `.ontos-internal/strategy/proposals/v3.3a/v3.3_Release_Plan.md`
- `.ontos-internal/strategy/proposals/v3.3a/v3.3_Track_A1_Implementation_Spec.md`
- `.ontos-internal/strategy/proposals/v3.3a/v3.3_Track_A1_Adversarial_Review.md`
- `.ontos-internal/strategy/proposals/v3.2.4/v3.2.4_PreA_Consolidation.md`

## Carry-Forward Notes for v3.3b
1. Preserve deprecation warnings when falling back to legacy archive/decision-history paths.
2. Resolve decision-history path resolution in `ontos/core/proposals.py` to avoid package-root lookups.

## Deliverables (next step)
- Track B implementation spec
- Track B review plan (Peer / Alignment / Adversarial)
- Explicit test matrix for scan scope + link parser + rename dry-run/apply modes
