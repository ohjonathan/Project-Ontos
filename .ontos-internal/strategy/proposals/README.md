# Proposal Folder Naming

Use these conventions for versioned proposal folders:

- Base format: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (example: `v3.2.2`)
- Letter suffix for related parallel tracks: `v3.2.1a`, `v3.2.1b`, `v3.2.1c`, `v3.2.1d`
- Do **not** insert an extra dot before the letter (use `v3.2.1d`, not `v.3.2.1d`)
- Keep suffixes alphabetical in order of creation

If there is a single proposal for a version, prefer the base format without a letter suffix.
