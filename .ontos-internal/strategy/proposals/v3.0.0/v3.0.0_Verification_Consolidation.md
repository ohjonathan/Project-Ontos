**Purpose:** Final go/no-go decision for Phase C  
**Phase:** B.4 Consolidation  
**Date:** 2026-01-17  
**Status:** COMPLETE

## 1. Verification Summary

| Reviewer | Role | Verdict | Blocking Issues Remaining |
|----------|------|---------|---------------------------|
| Gemini 3.0 Pro | Peer | **PASS** | 0 |
| Codex | Alignment | **PASS** | 0 |
| Claude | Adversarial | **PASS** | 0 |

**Consensus:** 3/3 PASS  
**Overall:** **APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

---

## 2. Blocking Issue Status

| Original Issue | CA Fix | Verification Status |
|----------------|--------|---------------------|
| **B1: AGENTS template missing** | Appendix A: Complete template with all sections, placeholders, Core Invariants | ✅ **RESOLVED** — All three reviewers confirm template is complete and implementable |
| **B2: Transform rules missing** | Appendix B: Explicit mapping table for all sections | ✅ **RESOLVED** — All three reviewers confirm rules are unambiguous |

**Both critical blockers resolved.** Implementation can proceed.

---

## 3. Major Issue Status

| Issue | CA Response | Verified By | Status |
|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| M1: PyPI verification | TestPyPI install + `ontos --version` | Gemini | ✅ Resolved |
| M3: Data cleanup verification | Added `ontos doctor` requirement | Codex | ✅ Resolved |
| M4: Golden test required | Made required in acceptance criteria | Codex | ✅ Resolved |
| M5: Tests gate publish | Added test gating to workflow | Claude | ✅ Resolved |
| M6: Version stamp | Added `Generated by Ontos v{version}` to template | Claude, Gemini | ✅ Resolved |
| M7: Template injection | Restricted to numeric/timestamp values | Claude | ✅ Resolved |
| M8: Backup on --force | Create `.bak` before overwrite | Claude | ✅ Resolved |

**All major issues resolved.**

---

## 4. Minor Gaps Identified (Non-Blocking)

| Gap | Found By | Severity | Action |
|-----|----------|----------|--------|
| X-H6: Missing sources not explicitly handled | Claude | Medium | Recommend: Add explicit behavior for missing sources during staleness check. Can address during implementation. |
| Backticks in .cursorrules | Claude | Low | Recommend: Verify backticks work in Cursor's format during implementation. |

**Neither gap blocks implementation.** Both can be addressed during Phase C or as follow-ups.

---

## 5. New Issues Found During Verification

| New Issue | Found By | Severity | Blocks Implementation? |
|-----------|----------|----------|------------------------|
| None | — | — | — |

**No new blocking issues introduced by CA fixes.**

---

## 6. Reviewer Notes Worth Preserving

| Note | From | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| "Core Invariants section significantly improves safety for LLM interactions" | Gemini | Confirms Gemini's original suggestion was valuable |
| "TestPyPI `--no-deps` might miss dependency issues, but acceptable tradeoff" | Claude | Known limitation; main PyPI would still catch import failures |
| "Extra `ontos map --strict` verification is additive but within scope" | Codex | Confirms no scope creep |
| "Template is copy-paste implementable" | Claude | High confidence in implementation readiness |

---

## 7. Deferred Items Confirmed Acceptable

| Deferred Item | Rationale | All Reviewers Accept? |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------|
| M2: Staleness misses package updates | Not in Cofounder Response scope | ✅ Yes |
| m6: TestPyPI version collision | Known limitation; version bump required | ✅ Yes |
| Windows CI | Deferred to v3.0.3; error messaging added | ✅ Yes |

---

## 8. Final Checklist

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| B1 (AGENTS template) resolved | ✅ |
| B2 (transform rules) resolved | ✅ |
| All major issues (M1-M8) resolved | ✅ |
| No scope creep | ✅ |
| No new blocking issues | ✅ |
| 3/3 reviewers pass | ✅ |

---

## 9. Final Decision

**Status:** ✅ **APPROVED FOR PHASE C**

**Spec v1.1 is ready for implementation.**

**Next Steps:**
1. Chief Architect (Codex) incorporates all accepted changes into spec v1.1
2. Chief Architect writes Phase C.1 Implementation Prompt for Antigravity
3. Proceed to Phase C (Implementation)

---

## 10. Uncomfortable Questions — Final Status

| Question | CA Answer | Reviewer Assessment |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| LLM testing? | "Will add manual test for 2 LLMs" | Claude: ✅ "Honest answer with commitment" |
| PyPI fallback? | "Manual token + git+ install path" | Claude: ✅ "Two fallbacks specified" |
| Windows CI? | "Deferred + error messaging" | Claude: ✅ "Pragmatic" |

All uncomfortable questions answered satisfactorily.
