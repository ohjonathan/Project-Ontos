# Ontos v3.0 LLM Review Board Synthesis
## With Founder Decisions & Open Questions

**Document Version:** 2.0 (Consolidated with Founder Decisions)
**Generated:** 2026-01-09
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** ACTIVE - Ready for LLM Review

---

## Document Purpose

This document consolidates strategic analysis from 5 LLMs regarding Ontos v3.0 direction, now annotated with founder decisions. It serves two purposes:

1. **Decision Record:** Documents what has been decided, declined, or deferred with reasoning
2. **Open Questions:** Presents unresolved questions in decision matrix format for LLM input

---

## Instructions for Reviewing LLMs

**How to Use This Document:**
1. Read the **Project Context** and **Core Philosophy** sections first
2. Review **Founder Decisions** to understand what's already decided
3. For each **Open Question** in Part 9, provide a structured response using the template below

**Response Requirements:**
- Use the **strict response template** in Part 9 for each open question
- Check **philosophy alignment** - recommendations must respect Ontos principles
- Provide **confidence levels** so founder can weigh certainty
- **Dissent is welcome** - if you disagree with Founder Lean, explain why clearly

**Philosophy Quick Reference (check alignment against these):**

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| "Readable, not retrievable" | Human-readable files over databases/vector stores |
| "Glass box, not black box" | Users see exactly what Ontos does |
| Simplicity | Minimal cognitive load to get started |
| Lightweight | Zero deps for core, fast startup, small footprint |
| Local-first | Data stays in repo, no external service dependencies |
| Curation over ceremony | Human judgment matters; friction creates signal |
| Zero-dep core | Core functionality has no external dependencies |

**Confidence Level Definitions:**

| Level | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **High** | Strong conviction, clear trade-offs understood, low risk of being wrong |
| **Medium** | Reasonable recommendation, but some uncertainty or missing information |
| **Low** | Speculative, needs more research, significant unknowns remain |

**Dissent Handling:**
- It is **acceptable and encouraged** to disagree with Founder Lean
- If recommending against Founder Lean, clearly state your reasoning
- Explain what conditions or information would change your recommendation
- Founder will weigh thoughtful dissent seriously

---

## Project Context

**Vision:** "AI context should be readable, not retrievable. Glass box, not black box."

**Punchline:** "Never explain twice. Own your context."

**Philosophy:** Simplicity, lightweight, minimal friction - "I just want it to work"

**Current State:** ~11,500 lines Python, script-based, zero dependencies

**Important Note:** Currently single-user (founder only). Not open source. This affects migration concerns - there are no external users to break.

---

## Source Analyses

This synthesis draws from 5 independent LLM analyses:

| LLM | Identifier | Focus Area | Key Contribution |
|-----|------------|------------|------------------|
| **A** | ChatGPT | Practical MCP implementation | Doctor command, JSON output, concurrency safety |
| **B** | Claude Opus 4.5 (Chief Architect) | Strategic options analysis | Phased approach, risk assessment, "burnout" flag |
| **C** | Claude Opus 4.5 (Reviewer) | Feature prioritization | Export formats, weighted scoring, competitive positioning |
| **D** | Gemini DeepThink (Codebase) | Code-level analysis | "God Script" identification, pydantic, watchdog |
| **E** | Gemini DeepThink (Brief) | Architecture patterns | "Tool to Protocol" pivot, shim hooks, hybrid persistence |

## Founder Decisions Summary

### Quick Reference Table

| Topic | Decision | Reasoning |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **pip install ontos** | ADOPT | Clean, serves purpose quickly, industry standard |
| **MCP as primary interface** | DECLINE | Too much friction and maintenance; keep as optional layer |
| **MCP as optional layer** | ADOPT | Adds value for dynamic queries and agentic connections |
| **Legacy install.py** | DECLINE | Retiring - only user is founder, pip replaces it |
| **Global CLI + local data** | ADOPT | "Exactly how git works" - proven pattern |
| **Daemon as default** | DECLINE | Not necessary until MCP/agentic capabilities stabilize |
| **Magic defaults / zero-config** | ADOPT | Reduces friction, aligns with philosophy |
| **Doctor/health command** | ADOPT | Prevents "why isn't it working" issues |
| **Kill python3 ontos.py syntax** | ADOPT | Not necessary, only user is founder |
| **Declarative config (TOML)** | ADOPT | Consensus from multiple LLMs, cleaner than executable Python |
| **Progressive disclosure** | ADOPT | Power features exist but aren't in user's face initially |
| **S3 archive backend** | DEFER | Local first; S3 in later v3.x as needed |
| **Cross-repo federation** | DEFER | v4.0 territory - not needed for current scope |
| **MCP server timing** | DEFER | Later v3.x (not 3.1/3.2); finish local features first |
| **Zero-dependency rule** | PRESERVE | Keep for core; MCP layer can add deps via optional install |

---

## Part 1: Distribution Model

### Original LLM Positions

| Item | Consensus Level | LLM Positions |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| pip install ontos | Strong (5/5) | All recommend as primary distribution |
| MCP as primary | Weak (1/5) | 4 recommend against, 1 neutral |
| MCP as optional | Strong (4/5) | Consensus on optional add-on pattern |
| Legacy install.py | Split (1/5) | A: keep for air-gapped; E: "injection anti-pattern" |

### Founder Decisions

**ADOPTED: pip install ontos**
- **Reasoning:** Clean distribution model, serves purpose quickly and easily. Industry standard for Python tools. Enables "install once, use everywhere" without per-repo script injection.

**ADOPTED: MCP as optional layer**
- **Reasoning:** MCP can add value for dynamic queries and direct agentic LLM connections. However, the friction and maintenance required for MCP makes it unsuitable as primary interface. It will be a layer on top, accessible via `pip install ontos[mcp]`.

**DECLINED: MCP as primary interface**
- **Reasoning:** Too much friction and maintenance overhead. Current architecture (readable context files) already works well. MCP ecosystem still maturing. Don't want to depend on external protocol stability for core functionality.

**DECLINED: Legacy install.py**
- **Reasoning:** With pip distribution, install.py becomes redundant. Current user base is founder only - no external users to support. Clean break is acceptable.

---

## Part 2: Architecture

### Original LLM Positions

| Item | Consensus Level | LLM Positions |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| Global CLI + local data | Strong (5/5) | "Exactly how git works" |
| Daemon as default | Weak (1/5) | C: "solution looking for problem"; D,E: essential for v3 vision |
| Remove input() calls | Strong (4/5) | Required for MCP compatibility |
| Functional Core/Imperative Shell | Strong (4/5) | Current architecture is correct |

### Founder Decisions

**ADOPTED: Global CLI + local data pattern**
- **Reasoning:** Unanimous LLM agreement. Matches how git works - a proven, understood pattern. CLI is system-wide; data stays in repo where it belongs.

**ADOPTED: Preserve Functional Core / Imperative Shell**
- **Reasoning:** LLMs validated current architecture as "correctly designed for v3.0 extraction." The pure core can be packaged as library; UI layer can be replaced.

**DECLINED: Daemon as default**
- **Reasoning:** Adds operational complexity (process management, ports, auth tokens) without proportional value for most use cases. When MCP and agentic capabilities stabilize, this can be reconsidered. For now, keep it light.

**DEFERRED: MCP server to later v3.x**
- **Reasoning:** MCP is emerging standard but carries risk. Finish all local features first, stabilize pip distribution, then add MCP layer. Not targeting v3.1/3.2 - could be v3.5 or later depending on ecosystem maturity.

---

## Part 3: Core v3.0 Features

### Original LLM Positions

Each LLM surfaced different priorities. No single feature had strong consensus except foundational items (pip, CLI).

### Founder Decisions

**ADOPTED: Magic defaults / zero-config init**
- **Reasoning:** 3/5 LLMs recommend. Aligns directly with "I just want it to work" philosophy. Auto-detect git root, reasonable defaults, no upfront mode selection required.

**ADOPTED: Doctor/health command**
- **Reasoning:** LLM A states this "prevents 80% of 'why isn't it working'" issues. Low implementation cost, high UX value. Should show: repo root, docs dir, config location, schema versions, validation status.

**ADOPTED: Kill python3 ontos.py syntax**
- **Reasoning:** With pip install, `ontos` becomes the canonical command. Old syntax was artifact of script-based distribution. Only user is founder, so no migration concerns.

**ADOPTED: Declarative config (TOML)**
- **Reasoning:** 3/5 LLMs recommend moving from executable `ontos_config.py` to declarative `.ontos.toml`. Cleaner, more secure (no arbitrary code execution), easier for tools to parse.

**ADOPTED: Progressive disclosure**
- **Reasoning:** Pattern where complexity is hidden until needed. `ontos init` works with defaults; `ontos init --mode contributor` available for power users. L0/L1/L2 curation levels exist but users discover them progressively.

### Open Questions (See Decision Matrix Section)

The following features require further LLM input before deciding:
- JSON output mode
- Export to CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md
- Lazy loading / context slicing
- Passive observation (watchdog)
- Version pinning in .ontos.toml
- Shim hooks for git
- Script reorganization approach

---

## Part 4: UX/Friction Reduction

### Original LLM Positions

| Item | Consensus Level | LLM Positions |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| One-command install | Strong (5/5) | Universal agreement |
| Declarative config | Majority (3/5) | A, C, D recommend TOML |
| Auto-configure MCP clients | Unique (1/5) | Only D mentions patching config files |

### Founder Decisions

**ADOPTED: One-command install**
- **Reasoning:** `pip install ontos` then `ontos init` per repo. Simple, standard, memorable.

**ADOPTED: Progressive disclosure pattern**
- **Explanation:** Users start with simple defaults. Power features (curation levels, modes, advanced config) are discoverable when needed, not forced upfront. Think: `git init` vs `git init --bare --template=...`

### Open Questions

- Auto-configure MCP clients - defer discussion to later v3.x when MCP is implemented

---

## Part 5: Scalability

### Original LLM Positions

| Item | Consensus Level | LLM Positions |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| S3 archive | Split | A,E: recommend; C: advises against; D: plugin only |
| Cross-repo federation | Majority defer (3/5) | v4.0+ territory |
| Context slicing | Minority (2/5) | D,E recommend for scale |

### Founder Decisions

**DEFERRED: S3 archive backend - local first**
- **Reasoning:** Understand both sides of the debate. Local-first aligns with philosophy, but large projects will eventually need external storage to avoid repo bloat. Decision: Local for v3.0 core, S3 as optional feature in later v3.x. Let user choose their storage model.

**DEFERRED: Cross-repo federation - v4.0 territory**
- **Reasoning:** Ontos isn't built for massive multi-team projects currently. If enterprise use case emerges, can revisit. For now, single-repo focus keeps complexity manageable.

### Open Questions

- Context slicing implementation (see Decision Matrix)

---

## Part 6: Risks & Concerns

### Original LLM Positions

| Risk | Consensus Level | LLM Positions |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| MCP security model weak | Strong (4/5) | Major concern flagged |
| Breaking v2.x workflows | Majority (3/5) | Migration tooling critical |
| Complexity overload | Strong (4/5) | Scope creep risk |
| Code quality issues | Split | B,D identify script problems |

### Founder Decisions

**ADOPTED: Staged implementation**
- **Reasoning:** Careful stage-by-stage implementation prevents breaking v2 workflows. Since founder is only user, can be more aggressive, but discipline is good practice.

**ADOPTED: Clean script architecture**
- **Reasoning:** Current state has overlapping concerns across 25+ scripts, including "God Script" issues (ontos_end_session.py at 1,625 lines). v3.0 should reorganize into clear, single-purpose modules. The pip package structure naturally encourages this.
- **Note:** Python package hides complexity from users - scripts no longer visible in repo.

### Open Questions

- MCP security requirements (detailed discussion needed)
- Pydantic requirement (dependency trade-off)
- Script reorganization approach (explicit goal vs natural outcome)

---

## Part 7: Key Disagreements Resolved

### S3 Archive Backend
- **LLM A, E:** Recommend as MCP Tool for "infinite memory"
- **LLM C:** Scores 3.4/10 - "violates local-first"
- **LLM D:** Plugin only to avoid bloat
- **FOUNDER DECISION:** Local first for v3.0. S3 as optional feature in later v3.x, user-selectable. Careful about stability/simplicity impact.

### Zero-Dependency Rule
- **LLM A, B, C:** Keep for core, optional deps for MCP
- **LLM D:** "We drop this rule" - need pydantic
- **FOUNDER DECISION:** Preserve zero-dep for core. MCP layer can introduce dependencies via `pip install ontos[mcp]`. Don't over-invest in MCP given ecosystem uncertainty.

### MCP Timing
- **LLM B:** Defer to v3.5+ (6-12 months)
- **LLM D, E:** Core v3.0 work now
- **LLM A, C:** Middle ground - v3.1/v3.2
- **FOUNDER DECISION:** Defer to later v3.x. Not v3.1/v3.2. Finish local features first, stabilize, then consider MCP. MCP is only a layer on top, so timing is flexible.

### Legacy install.py
- **LLM A:** Keep for air-gapped users
- **LLM E:** "Injection anti-pattern" - eliminate
- **FOUNDER DECISION:** Kill it. Only user is founder. pip install replaces it entirely. No external users to support.

### Daemon/Server Default
- **LLM C:** "Solution looking for a problem"
- **LLM D, E:** Essential for v3 vision
- **FOUNDER DECISION:** Not default. Daemon adds operational complexity without proportional value currently. Revisit when MCP/agentic capabilities stabilize.

## Part 9: Open Questions Decision Matrix

### Required Response Template

For each open question, provide your response using this **exact structure**:

```markdown
**Recommendation:** [Option A / Option B / Option C / Alternative: describe]

**Confidence:** [High / Medium / Low]

**Philosophy Alignment:** [Aligns / Tension / Conflicts]
Brief explanation of how this recommendation relates to Ontos principles.

**Reasoning:**
- Primary argument for this recommendation
- Secondary considerations
- Trade-offs you weighed

**Implementation Complexity:** [Low / Medium / High]
- Estimated effort (e.g., "~2 days", "significant refactor", "simple flag addition")
- Dependencies or prerequisites required
- Risk factors

**Dissent Note:** _(Include only if disagreeing with Founder Lean)_
- Why you recommend against the Founder's inclination
- What evidence or conditions would change your recommendation
```

**Complexity Scale:**
| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Low** | Few hours to 1-2 days; isolated change; no new dependencies |
| **Medium** | 3-5 days; touches multiple files; may need testing infrastructure |
| **High** | 1+ weeks; architectural change; new dependencies; migration concerns |

**Important:** Copy the template structure exactly. The founder will compare responses across multiple LLMs, and consistent structure enables comparison.

---

### Q1: JSON Output Mode

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Context** | LLM A suggests `--json` flag for scripting/automation. "You'll want this the minute people start scripting around Ontos." |
| **Option A** | Add JSON output mode now (`ontos map --json`, `ontos query --json`) |
| **Option B** | Keep Markdown as sole format; defer JSON until demand emerges |
| **Trade-offs** | A: More work now, future-proofs for automation. B: Simpler, YAGNI principle. |
| **Founder Lean** | Uncertain. Want LLM input on when/why JSON becomes necessary. |
| **LLM Response** | _(Space for LLM recommendation)_ |

---

### Q2: Export to CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Context** | LLM C calls this "80/20 feature" - ~2 days effort, immediate value. Positions Ontos as "source of truth" generating tool-specific artifacts. |
| **Option A** | Implement `ontos export --format agents.md` etc. |
| **Option B** | Keep Ontos tool-agnostic; let users manually reference context map |
| **Trade-offs** | A: Immediate value, increases adoption. B: Avoids building for specific LLMs, stays universal. |
| **Founder Lean** | Skeptical. Whole purpose of Ontos is universal across all agentic LLMs, not Claude-specific. Is this overvaluing tool-specific integration? |
| **LLM Response** | _(Space for LLM recommendation)_ |

---

### Q3: Lazy Loading / Context Slicing

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Context** | LLM D, E recommend for scale. "Summary ~500 tokens, lazy load details" for 10k+ docs. Current context map may exceed token limits as projects grow. |
| **Option A** | Implement now: `ontos://map/summary` (lightweight) + `ontos://doc/{id}` (on-demand) |
| **Option B** | Defer until proven necessary; current approach works for reasonable project sizes |
| **Trade-offs** | A: Future-proofs, but adds complexity. B: Simpler, but may hit walls at scale. |
| **Founder Lean** | Want direction, but can we achieve this without sacrificing lightweight simplicity? |
| **LLM Response** | _(Space for LLM recommendation)_ |

---

### Q4: Passive Observation (Watchdog)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Context** | LLM D suggests using `watchdog` to monitor file changes in background. When agent calls `log_session`, server already knows which atoms were touched. "Removes 80% of friction." |
| **Option A** | Implement file watching with auto-detection of changes |
| **Option B** | Keep explicit: user/agent specifies impacts manually |
| **Option C** | Detect-and-flag: detect changes but require confirmation |
| **Trade-offs** | A: Magic, but adds background process and dependency. B: Explicit, aligns with "curation" philosophy. C: Balanced approach. |
| **Founder Lean** | Option C (detect-and-flag) seems reasonable. Want to hear if this conflicts with curation philosophy. |
| **LLM Response** | _(Space for LLM recommendation)_ |

---

### Q5: Version Pinning in .ontos.toml

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Context** | LLM D recommends: `[ontos] required_version = ">=3.0.0, <4.0.0"`. Prevents version mismatch corruption when team members have different global installs. |
| **Option A** | Implement version pinning with startup check |
| **Option B** | Trust users to manage versions; no enforcement |
| **Trade-offs** | A: Prevents subtle bugs, but adds ceremony. B: Simpler, but risk of version drift. |
| **Founder Lean** | Is this necessary given single-user context? When would it become necessary? |
| **LLM Response** | _(Space for LLM recommendation)_ |

---

### Q6: Shim Hooks for Git

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Context** | LLM E suggests a "shim" pattern: `.git/hooks/pre-push` delegates to global `ontos hook pre-push`. Keeps repo clean but maintains safety net. |
| **Option A** | Implement shim hooks that delegate to global CLI |
| **Option B** | Keep current hook approach (scripts in repo) |
| **Option C** | Drop hooks entirely; rely on manual discipline |
| **Trade-offs** | A: Clean repo, but depends on global install. B: Self-contained, but "folder pollution." C: Simplest, but loses safety net. |
| **Founder Lean** | Sounds good conceptually. Does it solve a real problem? |
| **LLM Response** | _(Space for LLM recommendation)_ |

---

### Q7: Auto-Configure MCP Clients

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Context** | LLM D suggests `ontos init` could auto-patch `claude_desktop_config.json` and `.cursor/mcp.json` to register the server. "Removes hardest part of MCP adoption." |
| **Option A** | Implement auto-configuration of MCP client files |
| **Option B** | Provide documentation/instructions only |
| **Trade-offs** | A: Reduces friction significantly. B: Avoids touching external config files (overstepping?). |
| **Founder Lean** | Deferred to later v3.x when MCP implemented. But is this helpful or overstepping? |
| **LLM Response** | _(Space for LLM recommendation)_ |

---

### Q8: Context Slicing Without Sacrificing Lightweight

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Context** | Scalability vs simplicity tension. Can we support large graphs without adding complexity for small projects? |
| **Option A** | Implement progressive complexity: simple for small, scales for large |
| **Option B** | Accept limitations: "Ontos is for projects up to X docs" |
| **Trade-offs** | A: Best of both worlds if achievable. B: Clear scope, simpler implementation. |
| **Founder Lean** | Is Option A actually achievable? What's the implementation approach? |
| **LLM Response** | _(Space for LLM recommendation)_ |

---

### Q9: MCP Security Model

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Context** | 4/5 LLMs flag MCP security as concern. "Full user permissions with no sandboxing." "Servers create arbitrary data access and code execution paths." |
| **Option A** | Implement defense-in-depth: localhost-only, auth tokens, read-only default, audit logging |
| **Option B** | Minimal security: localhost binding only, trust model |
| **Trade-offs** | A: Safer, but more implementation work. B: Simpler, but higher risk exposure. |
| **Founder Lean** | Want detailed discussion. What's the minimum viable security that doesn't create liability? |
| **LLM Response** | _(Space for LLM recommendation)_ |

---

### Q10: Pydantic Requirement

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Context** | LLM D recommends pydantic for schema validation. "Agents speak JSON Schema; Pydantic generates this for free." Adds ~15MB dependency. |
| **Option A** | Add pydantic as core dependency |
| **Option B** | Add pydantic only for MCP layer (`ontos[mcp]`) |
| **Option C** | Avoid pydantic; use stdlib for validation |
| **Trade-offs** | A: Best DX, but breaks zero-dep. B: Balanced. C: Preserves philosophy, more manual work. |
| **Founder Lean** | Prefer Option B or C. Don't want to break zero-dep for core. |
| **LLM Response** | _(Space for LLM recommendation)_ |

---

### Q11: Script Reorganization Approach

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Context** | Current state: 25+ scripts with overlapping concerns, "God Script" at 1,625 lines. v3.0 pip packaging is opportunity to reorganize. |
| **Option A** | Explicit goal: Plan microservice-style modules (ontos/core/session.py, ontos/core/validation.py) |
| **Option B** | Implicit: Let reorganization happen naturally during pip packaging |
| **Option C** | Minimal: Keep current structure, just package it |
| **Trade-offs** | A: Clean result, more planning needed. B: Organic, may not fully address issues. C: Fastest, but carries tech debt forward. |
| **Founder Lean** | Gut says reorganization needed, but want LLM input on approach. |
| **LLM Response** | _(Space for LLM recommendation)_ |

---

### Q12: Python vs Node/TS for MCP

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Context** | LLM B notes "Python is second-class in MCP ecosystem (Node/TS dominant)." Most MCP tooling, examples, and community focus on JavaScript ecosystem. |
| **Option A** | Stay with Python - ecosystem will mature, official SDK exists |
| **Option B** | Consider Node.js for MCP layer only |
| **Option C** | Consider full rewrite in TypeScript |
| **Trade-offs** | A: Leverages existing codebase, but may face ecosystem friction. B: Best MCP support, but split codebase. C: Massive undertaking, clean slate. |
| **Founder Lean** | Should we even consider changing from Python? Why or why not? |
| **LLM Response** | _(Space for LLM recommendation)_ |

---

### Q13: JSON vs Markdown as Primary Output

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Context** | Currently Markdown is primary (Ontos_Context_Map.md). JSON would enable programmatic consumption, MCP integration. But humans read Markdown. |
| **Option A** | JSON primary, Markdown generated from JSON |
| **Option B** | Markdown primary, JSON as optional export |
| **Option C** | Dual-primary: both generated simultaneously |
| **Trade-offs** | A: Machine-first, but loses human readability primacy. B: Human-first, current approach. C: Both, but maintenance overhead. |
| **Founder Lean** | Leaning B. "Readable, not retrievable" is core philosophy. But want input. |
| **LLM Response** | _(Space for LLM recommendation)_ |

---

## Part 10: Summary - V3.0 Direction

### Core Philosophy Preserved

The following principles from Ontos v1/v2 remain non-negotiable in v3.0:

| Principle | What It Means | How v3.0 Honors It |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **"Readable, not retrievable"** | Context should be human-readable files, not hidden in databases or vector stores | Markdown remains primary output; data stays in visible repo files |
| **"Glass box, not black box"** | Users understand exactly what Ontos does and where data lives | No hidden state, no magic directories users can't inspect |
| **"Never explain twice"** | Document once, use everywhere | Universal format works across all agentic LLMs, not tool-specific |
| **Simplicity** | Minimal cognitive load to get started | One-command install, zero-config init, progressive disclosure |
| **Lightweight** | No bloat, fast startup, minimal footprint | Zero dependencies for core; optional deps only for extensions |
| **Local-first** | Your data, your repo, your control | No external service dependencies for core function |
| **Curation over ceremony** | Human judgment matters; friction creates signal | L0/L1/L2 levels preserved; automation assists but doesn't replace curation |

---

### What v3.0 IS About

**v3.0 is the "Distribution & Polish" release.** The core Ontos functionality is proven (v2.9.5 works). v3.0 focuses on:

1. **Professional Distribution**
   - `pip install ontos` - industry-standard Python packaging
   - Single global install, works across all repos
   - No more "scripts in your repo" - clean separation of tool from data

2. **Friction Reduction**
   - Magic defaults - `ontos init` just works without interrogation
   - `ontos doctor` - diagnose issues before they become frustrations
   - Progressive disclosure - power features exist but don't overwhelm new users

3. **Clean Architecture**
   - Declarative config (.ontos.toml) replaces executable Python config
   - Script consolidation - address "God Script" and overlapping concerns
   - Hidden complexity - pip package structure means users see data, not tooling

4. **Foundation for Future**
   - Architecture prepared for MCP layer (but not implementing yet)
   - Schema versioning ready for v3.0 format
   - Clean boundaries that enable future extensions

---

### What v3.0 is NOT About

**v3.0 explicitly avoids:**

| Not Doing | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| **MCP as primary interface** | Too much friction/maintenance; ecosystem still maturing; violates "simplicity" |
| **Daemon/server as default** | Adds operational complexity without proportional value for current use cases |
| **Tool-specific exports** | Ontos is universal context, not a CLAUDE.md generator |
| **Cloud storage (S3)** | Local-first philosophy; cloud is optional extension for later |
| **Cross-repo federation** | Scope creep; single-repo focus keeps complexity manageable |
| **Breaking changes for features** | Stability over novelty; staged implementation protects workflows |
| **Heavy dependencies** | Zero-dep core is a feature, not a limitation |
| **Automation replacing curation** | Watchdog/detection may assist, but human judgment remains central |

**The v3.0 mantra:** "Make what exists better distributed, not more complex."

---

### MCP Approach: The Layer Strategy

This was a central question in the LLM analyses. Here is the decided approach:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     USER INTERACTION                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

**Key MCP Decisions:**

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **MCP is a layer, not the foundation** | Core functionality must work without MCP; MCP adds value but isn't required |
| **Optional install: `pip install ontos[mcp]`** | Users who don't need MCP never see its dependencies |
| **Deferred to later v3.x** | Finish local features first; let MCP ecosystem mature |
| **Not v3.1/v3.2** | Could be v3.5 or later; no rush given layer approach |
| **Preserve zero-dep core** | MCP layer can have dependencies; core cannot |
| **No daemon as default** | When MCP ships, it's opt-in, not forced |

**Why this approach?**

1. **Risk mitigation:** MCP ecosystem is still evolving. Heavy investment now may require rework later.
2. **Philosophy alignment:** "I just want it to work" means CLI + readable files, not server configuration.
3. **Incremental value:** MCP adds value for power users (dynamic queries, agentic integration) without burdening everyone.
4. **Reversibility:** If MCP fails to gain traction, Ontos isn't dependent on it.

### Primary v3.0 Deliverables (Confirmed)

| # | Deliverable | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | pip distribution (`pip install ontos`) | Confirmed |
| 2 | Magic defaults / zero-config init | Confirmed |
| 3 | Doctor/health command (`ontos doctor`) | Confirmed |
| 4 | Declarative config (`.ontos.toml`) | Confirmed |
| 5 | Kill legacy `install.py` | Confirmed |
| 6 | Kill `python3 ontos.py` syntax | Confirmed |
| 7 | Clean script architecture | Confirmed (specifics TBD via Q11) |

### Deferred Items

| Item | Target | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| MCP server | Later v3.x | Layer approach; ecosystem maturity needed |
| S3 archive | Later v3.x | Local-first; user-selectable when ready |
| Cross-repo federation | v4.0 | Enterprise feature; not current scope |

### Open for LLM Input

13 questions in decision matrix format (Part 9) requiring recommendations before implementation planning can finalize.
