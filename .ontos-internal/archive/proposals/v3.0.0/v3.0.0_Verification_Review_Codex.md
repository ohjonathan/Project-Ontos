## Data Cleanup Verification Fix

| Check | Pass? | Notes |

| Now aligns with Cofounder Response §11.4 | ✅ | Adds `ontos doctor` validation clean requirement. |
| Both checks required (map strict + doctor) | ✅ | Additional strictness but still within data cleanup scope. |
| Acceptance criteria updated | ✅ | CA response states criteria updated in spec v1.1. |

**Data Cleanup Fix Assessment:** Adequate

|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------|

| m6: TestPyPI version collision | "Known limitation; require version bump" | ✅ | Acceptable deferral; mitigation noted. |

## Your Original Concerns

| Your Issue | CA Response | Adequately Addressed? |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| A-M1: Golden test optional → should be required | Made required | ✅ |

**Verification Status:** PASS

**If PASS with notes:**
- Extra verification via `ontos map --strict` is additive but still within approved data cleanup scope.
