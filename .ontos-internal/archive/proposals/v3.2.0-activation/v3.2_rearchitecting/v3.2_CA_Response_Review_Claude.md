## Review of CA's Response to My Issues

### BLOCK-2: Export Rename is a Breaking Change

**My concern:** Renaming `export` breaks backward compatibility; confusion with `ontos agents` terminology.

**CA Response:** ACCEPT. Adopted subcommand approach: `export data` / `export claude` with deprecated alias.

**My verdict:** ✅ **Adequately addressed**

The subcommand pattern solves both problems:
- No breaking change (deprecated alias prints warning but still works)
- Clear namespace separation (`export data` vs `export claude` vs `agents`)

One minor note: the deprecated alias runs `export claude` by default. That's the right call for backward compat, but document it clearly so users aren't surprised when the warning appears.

### BLOCK-3: Decision Extraction Heuristics Will Fail

**My concern:** Heuristic extraction unreliable; should drop entirely and let AI do comprehension.

**CA Response:** PARTIALLY ACCEPT. Dropped heuristics, but added explicit frontmatter fields instead. CA explicitly disagreed with my "let AI figure it out" position:

> "Ontos's value proposition is deterministic, curated knowledge — not 'dump raw data and let the agent figure it out.'"

**My verdict:** ✅ **Adequately addressed**

**Do I accept the CA's reasoning for rejecting my "drop entirely" recommendation?**

Yes, with a clarification on what I was actually arguing.

My position wasn't "dump raw data." It was: "Don't pretend you can extract decisions when you can't." The CA heard this correctly and dropped the heuristics.

The explicit fields approach (`decision_summary`, `alternatives_rejected`) is actually consistent with Ontos philosophy. The user curates by adding the field. Ontos exports reliably. That's "curation over ceremony" done right — a small amount of ceremony (one field) yields deterministic output.

What I was arguing against was the illusion of extraction. The revised approach is honest: if you want decisions in your export, declare them explicitly.

**One caveat:** These fields are optional with no enforcement. That's fine for v3.2. But when `ontos decisions` ships in v3.3, you'll need to think about adoption. If nobody uses the fields, the command is useless. Consider:
- `ontos doctor` could flag documents with type `strategy` or `product` that lack `decision_summary`
- Documentation should emphasize the value proposition: "Add one field, get it in every export forever"

### Major Issues

| My Issue | CA Response | My Verdict |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Three commands is two too many | Reduced to 2 commands + 1 alias | ✅ **Accept** |
| No agent integration story | Will add agent workflow section | ✅ **Accept** (with condition) |
| Scope creep (v3.3+ work) | Rejected — claims reduced scope addresses it | ✅ **Accept** |

**Notes:**

**Three commands:** The `ontos migrate` alias gives users the single-command experience I wanted. Power users who need composability get separate commands. Clean.

**Agent integration:** I accept that this will be addressed, but I want to see the agent workflow protocol *before* the implementation spec, not after. The CA lists this as a next step, which is correct. Don't let it slip.

**Scope creep:** I'm satisfied. The reduced scope (no heuristics, no YAML, no `ontos decisions` command) brings this back to v3.2-appropriate size. What remains is:
- Serialize existing data to JSON (straightforward)
- Analyze dependency graph (you already have this logic)
- Generate markdown report (templating)

That's incremental, not transformative.

## New Issues from CA Response

| New Issue | Why It's a Problem | Severity |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| `migration_status` override field adds schema complexity | Another optional field to document, validate, and test. Not blocking, but track schema sprawl. | Low |
| Agent workflow protocol deferred to "next steps" | Risk of shipping CLI-only feature without agent story. | Medium |

**On the agent workflow:** The CA says "Write before spec" which is the right ordering. But the current proposal document has zero content on how an agent uses these commands. When the revised proposal lands, I want to see:

1. What an agent says/does when user requests migration help
2. What artifacts the agent produces
3. How the agent consumes `snapshot.json` and `analysis.md`

This doesn't need to be long — a single "Agent Workflow" section with a concrete example.

## Overall Assessment

**CA Response Quality:** ✅ **Thorough and well-reasoned**

The CA engaged seriously with all three reviews, made defensible decisions, and clearly documented the rationale for both acceptances and rejections. The reasoning for rejecting my "drop extraction entirely" position was sound.

**Proposal Status After Response:** ✅ **Ready to proceed to spec** (after required revisions)

The required changes list in section 6 is complete and actionable. Once those are applied, this is ready for implementation spec.

**Remaining Concerns:**

1. **Agent workflow must be written before spec.** Don't let this become an afterthought.

2. **Schema sprawl monitoring.** v3.2 adds three new optional fields (`decision_summary`, `alternatives_rejected`, `migration_status`). That's fine, but track cumulative complexity. Each optional field is documentation debt, validation edge cases, and agent instruction updates.

3. **Adoption path for decision fields.** Without heuristic extraction, the value of these fields depends entirely on users adding them. Consider gentle nudges in `ontos doctor` or scaffold workflows.
