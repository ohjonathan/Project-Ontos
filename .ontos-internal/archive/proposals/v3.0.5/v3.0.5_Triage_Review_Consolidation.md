# v3.0.5 Triage Review Consolidation

**Project:** Ontos v3.0.5  
**Phase:** Pre-A (Triage Validation)  
**Purpose:** Synthesize review board feedback on Chief Architect's triage decisions  
**Date:** 2026-01-20

## Part 1: Verdict Summary

| Reviewer | Role | Verdict | Challenges | Blocking? |
|----------|------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Claude | Technical | Approved | 0 | No |
| ChatGPT | Strategic/UX | Request Revision | 1 | **Yes** |
| Gemini | Strategic | Approved | 0 | No |

**Consensus:** 2/3 Approved  
**Blocking challenges:** 1  
**Overall:** CA must respond first

## Part 2: Challenges Raised

### [UX-1]: Init Installs Hooks by Default

**CA's Decision:** In scope (documentation fix only, severity Low)  
**CA's Rationale:** `--skip-hooks` flag exists; issue is documentation/visibility, not behavior.

**Challenges:**

| Reviewer | Challenge Type | Argument |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| ChatGPT | Misunderstanding | CA addressed discoverability, not the core concern: **default silent side effects** on first-run create distrust. Docs don't remove the footgun—users get repo mutation before understanding Ontos. |

**Challenge Assessment:**

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is this a factual misunderstanding by CA? | **Yes.** ChatGPT's concern was *default behavior + silent repo mutation*, not merely that users can't find `--skip-hooks`. CA interpreted it as a documentation gap. |
| Is this a severity disagreement? | Yes (secondary). ChatGPT rated "trust-critical"; CA rated "Low." |
| Is this a scope preference disagreement? | No. ChatGPT proposes a patch-scoped fix (preflight message + TTY confirmation). |
| Does this block Phase A? | **Yes.** This is a factual misunderstanding of the finding, not a priority disagreement. |

**Consolidation Recommendation:**
- [x] CA must address before Phase A

**Recommended Resolution Path:**

ChatGPT proposes a small, non-breaking behavioral mitigation:
1. On `ontos init`, print a clear preflight message listing hooks that will be installed.
2. In TTY contexts, prompt: `Install git hooks? [Y/n]` (default Yes for BC).
3. Support `--yes` for non-interactive mode; keep `--skip-hooks`.

CA should either:
- Accept and incorporate this into v3.0.5 scope, OR
- Explain why this is out of scope for patch (e.g., introduces new behavior, testing burden), and ChatGPT will decide whether to accept the rejection.

## Part 3: Unanimous Acceptance

Issues where all reviewers accepted CA's decision:

| Issue ID | CA Decision | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| VER-1 | In scope (trivial fix) | Claude: exact match |
| MCP-1 | In scope (import warning) | All agree warning is appropriate |
| MCP-2 | Out of scope (v4.0 roadmap) | All accept deferral despite strategic urgency (Gemini) |
| CFG-1 | Defer to v3.1 | All accept; Claude/ChatGPT note it's High severity but deferral is correct |
| WRP-1 | Test + document | All accept; Claude clarifies arg mismatch vs PYTHONPATH are separate issues |
| UX-2 | Update Known Issues | All accept; tied to WRP-1 testing output |
| STR-1 | Escalate (business decision) | All accept; licensing is not patch scope |
| STR-2 | Escalate (business decision) | ChatGPT/Gemini accept |
| STR-3 | Defer to v3.1+ | Gemini accepts; breaking schema change |
| CQ-1 through CQ-5 | Defer/Reject | Claude accepts all code quality decisions |
| CQ-6 | Rejected | Claude accepts but notes CA's rationale is technically incorrect — see Part 6 |
| PLT-1 | Defer to v3.2+ | Claude accepts; requires test infrastructure |
| UX-3 | Defer to v3.1 | Claude accepts |
| DOC-1, DOC-2 | Out of scope | Claude accepts |

---

## Part 4: Findings Reported as Missing

| Reviewer | Missing Finding | Assessment |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Claude | Frontmatter parsing has no size limit | Not critical for patch; can remain untracked |
| Claude | No test suite in package | Standard PyPI practice; not a blocking concern |

**Assessment:** Claude self-classified these as Low severity and explicitly stated they can remain untracked for v3.0.5.

## Part 5: Action Items for Chief Architect

### Before Phase A (Blocking):

| # | Action | Addresses Challenge | Reviewer(s) |
|---|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Respond to UX-1 challenge: either accept ChatGPT's proposed mitigation (preflight message + TTY confirmation) OR explain why it's out of patch scope | UX-1 | ChatGPT |

### Recommended but not blocking:

| # | Action | Addresses Challenge | Reviewer(s) |
|---|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Clarify WRP-1 rationale: "commands now execute" conflates PYTHONPATH fix with arg mismatch. Expect arg-passing bugs during testing. | WRP-1 | Claude |
| 2 | Correct CQ-6 rejection rationale: say "stdlib-only design in core/ is intentional" not "PyYAML is used" (factually incorrect for `serialize_frontmatter()`). | CQ-6 | Claude |
| 3 | Add CFG-1 mitigation to v3.0.5: runtime warning when wrapper commands run that they do not honor `.ontos.toml`. | CFG-1 | ChatGPT |
| 4 | Strategic items (STR-1, STR-2): assign owner + decision date so they don't stall. | STR-1, STR-2 | ChatGPT |
| 5 | Gemini notes MCP-2 should accelerate to v3.2/v3.5; STR-3 is P1 for v3.1. | MCP-2, STR-3 | Gemini |

---

## Part 6: Disagreements for the Record

Items where reviewers disagree with CA's decision but accept it:

| Issue ID | Reviewer | Their View | CA's View | Resolution |
|----------|----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| CFG-1 | Claude, ChatGPT | High severity (trust issue) | Medium severity | CA decision stands; deferral to v3.1 is correct regardless |
| MCP-2 | Gemini | Critical strategic risk; accelerate to v3.2 | Defer to v4.0 | CA decision stands; Gemini accepts patch constraint |
| CQ-6 | Claude | CA's rationale is factually wrong (PyYAML is NOT used in `serialize_frontmatter()`) but rejection is acceptable | "PyYAML is used" | CA decision stands; stdlib-only design is valid, rationale should be corrected |
| WRP-1 | Claude | CA conflates two issues (PYTHONPATH vs arg mismatch) | "commands now execute" | CA decision stands; testing will reveal arg issues |

---

## Part 7: Proceed Decision

**Recommendation:** CA Response Required

**Reason:** One blocking challenge (UX-1) requires CA response.

**Required Before Phase A:**
1. CA produces `v3.0.5_Triage_Response.md` addressing UX-1:
   - Accept ChatGPT's proposed mitigation (preflight message + TTY confirmation), OR
   - Explain why this behavioral change is out of patch scope
2. ChatGPT re-validates the response
3. If ChatGPT accepts CA's explanation → Proceed to Phase A
4. If ChatGPT rejects → Escalate to decision-maker

**If CA accepts UX-1 mitigation:**
- Update v3.0.5 scope to include:
  - Print preflight message listing hooks before installation
  - Add TTY confirmation prompt: `Install git hooks? [Y/n]`
  - Support `--yes` for non-interactive mode
- Then proceed to Phase A
