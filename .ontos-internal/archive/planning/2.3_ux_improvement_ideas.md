# Ontos v2.3: UX Improvement Ideas

*Reducing friction in the Ontos workflow.*

---

## 1. Activation Performance

### Problem
"Activate Ontos" is slow — can take up to a minute in some agentic CLIs (e.g., Antigravity). Current flow requires 4-5 sequential file reads:
1. `Ontos_Context_Map.md`
2. `mission.md`
3. `v2_strategy.md`
4. Recent logs
5. Any other relevant docs

### Proposed Solution: Summaries in Context Map
Add 50-word summaries to frontmatter, display them in context map. Agents read ONE file and get enough context to start.

**Implementation:**
1. Add `summary` field to frontmatter schema
2. Modify `ontos_generate_context_map.py` to display summaries
3. Update "Activate Ontos" instructions: read only context map, lazy-load full docs
4. Add summaries to core docs (mission, v2_strategy, schema, decision_history)

**Expected Result:** Activation becomes 1 read instead of 4-5.

---

## 2. Session Archival Friction

### Problem
Archiving a session requires multiple steps:
1. Run `ontos_generate_context_map.py`
2. Run `ontos_end_session.py "slug" -s "Name" -e type`
3. Read the generated log
4. Fill in placeholders (Goal, Decisions, Changes, Next Steps)
5. Commit

This is tedious, especially for agents.

### Proposed Solutions

**A. Single command archive**
Combine steps 1-2 into one command:
```bash
python3 .ontos/scripts/ontos_archive.py "slug" -s "Name" -e type
# Internally runs context map generation first
```

**B. Auto-fill from git**
Pre-populate session log fields from git history:
- **Goal:** Infer from branch name or first commit message
- **Changes:** Parse git diff for modified files
- **Next Steps:** Leave as placeholder (hardest to auto-generate)

**C. Interactive mode**
```bash
python3 .ontos/scripts/ontos_end_session.py --interactive
# Prompts: Slug? Source? Event type? (with autocomplete)
```

---

## 3. Command Syntax Memorization

### Problem
`ontos_end_session.py "slug" -s "Source" -e <type>` has multiple required flags. Event types (feature/fix/refactor/exploration/chore) aren't discoverable without reading docs.

### Proposed Solutions

**A. Smart defaults**
- Auto-detect `--source` from git config (`user.name`)
- Suggest slug from current branch name
- Infer event type from commit message patterns ("fix:", "feat:", etc.)

**B. Better help output**
```
Event types:
  feature     - New functionality
  fix         - Bug fix
  refactor    - Code restructuring
  exploration - Research/investigation
  chore       - Maintenance/cleanup
```

**C. Aliases**
```bash
# Instead of:
python3 .ontos/scripts/ontos_end_session.py "my-feature" -s "Claude" -e feature

# Allow:
ontos archive "my-feature"  # Uses defaults
```

---

## 4. Monthly Consolidation is Manual

### Problem
The v2.1 Smart Memory consolidation ritual is entirely manual:
1. Review oldest logs
2. Verify absorption into Space docs
3. Record in decision_history.md
4. Move logs to archive
5. Commit

No tooling helps identify which logs are ready or automates the move.

### Proposed Solutions

**A. Consolidation helper script**
```bash
python3 .ontos/scripts/ontos_consolidate.py --preview
# Shows: "5 logs older than 30 days ready for consolidation"
# Lists each with suggested decision_history entry
```

**B. Auto-archive threshold**
When `logs/` exceeds `LOG_RETENTION_COUNT`, warn during context map generation:
```
⚠️  17 logs in working memory (threshold: 15)
   Consider running: ontos_consolidate.py
```

---

## 5. Changelog Updates Forgotten

### Problem
Changes to Ontos tooling should update `Ontos_CHANGELOG.md`, but it's easy to forget. (Demonstrated in this session when agent pushed without updating changelog.)

### Proposed Solutions

**A. Pre-commit check**
If files in `.ontos/scripts/` are modified, warn if `Ontos_CHANGELOG.md` is not staged.

**B. Prompt in end_session**
When archiving a session that modified `.ontos/scripts/`, prompt:
```
You modified Ontos tooling. Update Ontos_CHANGELOG.md? (y/n)
```

---

## 6. Frontmatter Learning Curve

### Problem
New users need to understand:
- YAML syntax
- Type hierarchy (kernel → strategy → product → atom → log)
- `depends_on` vs `impacts`
- Required vs optional fields

### Proposed Solutions

**A. Better templates**
`_template.md` with inline comments:
```yaml
---
id: unique_identifier        # Required. Lowercase, underscores.
type: atom                   # Required. kernel|strategy|product|atom|log
status: active               # Required. active|deprecated|draft
depends_on: [parent_doc]     # What this doc builds upon
# impacts: [affected_doc]    # Only for logs. What Space docs this affects.
---
```

**B. Validation with suggestions**
When context map finds errors, suggest exact fix:
```
[ERROR] Missing required field 'type' in my_doc.md
  Fix: Add 'type: atom' to frontmatter (or: kernel, strategy, product)
```

**C. Quick-start wizard**
```bash
python3 .ontos/scripts/ontos_new.py
# Prompts: Doc name? Type? Parent doc?
# Creates file with correct frontmatter
```

---

## 7. No IDE Integration

### Problem
Everything is CLI-based. No VS Code extension for:
- Frontmatter syntax highlighting/validation
- Quick commands (archive, activate, maintain)
- Inline errors for broken links

### Proposed Solution
VS Code extension (future scope):
- YAML frontmatter schema validation
- Command palette integration
- Sidebar showing context map structure
- Hover tooltips showing doc summaries

*Lower priority — CLI-first is intentional, but IDE support would help adoption.*

---

## 8. Context Map as Single File

### Problem
For large projects, `Ontos_Context_Map.md` could become unwieldy. No way to filter or get partial views.

### Proposed Solutions

**A. Filtered generation**
```bash
python3 .ontos/scripts/ontos_generate_context_map.py --type atom
# Only shows atom-type docs
```

**B. Depth limiting**
```bash
python3 .ontos/scripts/ontos_generate_context_map.py --depth 2
# Only shows docs within 2 hops of kernel
```

*Lower priority — current projects are small enough.*

---

## 9. Impact Suggestions are Basic

### Problem
`ontos_end_session.py` suggests impacts based on git diff filenames, but it's not semantic. Changing `auth.py` doesn't automatically suggest `auth_flow.md`.

### Proposed Solution
Maintain a mapping file (`.ontos/impact_hints.yaml`):
```yaml
# Files → Docs mapping
src/auth/*: [auth_flow, security_model]
src/api/*: [api_spec]
tests/*: []  # No impact suggestions
```

When git diff shows `src/auth/oauth.py` changed, suggest `auth_flow` and `security_model`.

*Medium priority — helps accuracy of session logs.*

---

## 10. No Undo/Rollback

### Problem
If you archive a session incorrectly (wrong slug, wrong event type), there's no easy fix. You have to manually edit the log file and rename it.

### Proposed Solution
```bash
python3 .ontos/scripts/ontos_end_session.py --amend
# Re-opens last session log for editing
# Or: --delete to remove last session
```

*Lower priority — git provides history.*

---

## Priority Matrix

| Idea | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| 1. Summaries in context map | High | Medium | **P0** |
| 2. Single command archive | Medium | Low | **P1** |
| 3. Smart defaults for end_session | Medium | Low | **P1** |
| 4. Consolidation helper | Medium | Medium | P2 |
| 5. Changelog reminder | Low | Low | P2 |
| 6. Better templates/validation | Medium | Low | P2 |
| 7. VS Code extension | Medium | High | P3 |
| 8. Filtered context map | Low | Medium | P3 |
| 9. Impact hints mapping | Medium | Medium | P3 |
| 10. Session amend/delete | Low | Low | P3 |

---

## Next Steps

1. Implement P0: Summaries in context map (activation performance)
2. Implement P1: Streamline archive workflow
3. Gather user feedback on other friction points
