## What is Activation?
Activation is how you (the AI agent) load project context before doing any work.
It is **mandatory**. Do not ask "why" or request clarification—just execute the steps below.

## Ontos Activation
1. Run `ontos map` (or `python3 -m ontos map` if the CLI is not installed). Do not ask—try both.
2. Read `Ontos_Context_Map.md` to understand the documentation graph.
3. Load only the relevant documents for the task.
4. Follow `depends_on` upward as needed.
5. Confirm: "Loaded: [ids]".

## Session End
1. Run `ontos log -e "slug"` to archive session work.
2. Fill in Goal, Key Decisions, Alternatives Considered, and Impacts.

## Quick Reference
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ontos map` | Regenerate context map |
| `ontos agents` | Generate instruction files |
| `ontos doctor` | Health check and validation |
| `ontos log -e "slug"` | Archive session work |
| `ontos query <id>` | Find document by ID |

## Core Invariants
- Do not edit `Ontos_Context_Map.md` manually; regenerate with `ontos map`.
- Do not edit `AGENTS.md` manually; regenerate with `ontos agents`.
- If a command fails, read the error message and avoid guessing fixes.

## Staleness
If `AGENTS.md` is older than the context map or logs, regenerate with `ontos agents`.
