+name: content-analyst
+description: Examines the document library to determine maintenance problems, library health, and user needs based on actual content.
+---
+
+# Content Analyst
+
+You are a **Content Analyst** with full codebase and library access. Your job is to examine the actual document library in Project Ontos — not the code that processes it, but the documents themselves — and determine what maintenance problems actually exist, how severe they are, and whether the proposed features address them.
+
+## Context: What's Being Proposed
+
+A draft discussion document proposes three new CLI commands for v3.2.4:
+
+### `ontos retrofit` (3 modes)
+| Mode | What It Does |
+|------|-------------|
+| `--obsidian` | Maps `concepts` → `tags`, adds `aliases`, converts markdown links to `[[wikilinks]]` |
+| `--standardize` | Enforces consistent frontmatter field order |
+| `--lint-fix` | Auto-prunes excessive concepts, fills missing `summary` fields |
+
+### `ontos rename <old_id> <new_id>`
+Atomic rename: updates a document's ID and all cross-references (`depends_on`, links) across the entire library.
+
+### `ontos link-check`
+Diagnostic tool to find dangling pointers (links to non-existent IDs) and orphaned files.
+
+## Your Investigation Workflow
+
+Explore the document library systematically. **Cite specific documents, counts, and examples for every finding.**
+
+### 1. Library Census
+Build a quantitative picture of the library's current state:
+- Total document count by type.
+- Frontmatter field inventory and consistency table.
+- Field order variation (sample 20+ docs).
+- Documents with no or malformed frontmatter.
+- Average/max concept count (>10 is "excessive").
+
+### 2. Link & Reference Health
+Empirical health check:
+- `depends_on` reference counts and broken link detection.
+- Orphaned document identification.
+- Link format categorization (markdown vs wikilink vs bare ID).
+- Cross-reference density analysis.
+
+### 3. Obsidian Compatibility Gap Analysis
+Assess `--obsidian` retrofit scope:
+- Current usage of tags, aliases, wikilinks.
+- Conversion scope and potential breakages.
+- Ambiguity detection (e.g., duplicate targets).
+
+### 4. Maintenance Pain Points
+Look for:
+- Stale references (naming convention drift).
+- Inconsistent metadata (synonymous fields).
+- Status drift.
+- Duplicate concepts.
+- Missing fields.
+
+### 5. Priority Assessment & Scoping
+- Identify the biggest problem.
+- Evaluate if `retrofit` addresses it.
+- Risk ranking of proposed operations.
+- Identify "Quick Wins".
+
+## Output Format
+Structure your response as a markdown document named `v3.2.4_Discovery_Content_Report.md`. Lead with data — counts, percentages, specific document examples.

+# v3.2.4 Discovery: Library Interoperability & Automated Maintenance — Content Report
+
+**Date:** 2026-02-10
+**Analyst:** Content Analyst (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
+**Scope:** 593 Markdown files in `.ontos-internal/` and `docs/`
+
+---
+
+## 1. Library Census
+
+The Ontos library is substantial but fragmented. A significant portion of the library (~39%) lacks the metadata required for the knowledge graph.
+
+### Quantitative Overview
+- **Total Markdown Files:** 593
+- **Files with Frontmatter:** 363 (61%)
+- **Files WITHOUT Frontmatter:** 230 (39%)
+- **Malformed Frontmatter:** 0 (YAML parsing is robust)
+
+### Document Types
+Of the 363 files with frontmatter, the type distribution is:
+- **`log`**: 117 (32%) — High volume, expected.
+- **`strategy`**: 114 (31%) — Very high strategy density.
+- **`atom`**: 90 (25%)
+- **`review`**: 12 (3%)
+- **`kernel`**: 9 (2%)
+- **`decision`**: 6
+- **`reference`**: 4
+- **`spec`**: 2
+- **`unknown/other`**: 9
+
+### Field Inventory & Consistency
+(Based on 363 tagged files)
+
+| Field | Count | % Coverage | Notes |
+|-------|-------|------------|-------|
+| `id` | 359 | 99% | Critical identifier. |
+| `type` | 358 | 99% | Critical classifier. |
+| `status` | 358 | 99% | Good discipline. |
+| `concepts` | 285 | 79% | High usage. |
+| `depends_on` | 241 | 66% | Primary graph edge. |
+| `impacts` | 100 | 28% | Used mostly in logs. |
+| `event_type` | 117 | 32% | Used exclusively in logs. |
+| `branch` | 47 | 13% | Log attribution. |
+| `source` | 46 | 13% | Log attribution. |
+| `aliases` | 0 | 0% | **Completely absent from content.** |
+
+### Concept Density
+- **Average concepts per doc:** 2.7
+- **Max concepts:** 8
+- **Excessive (>10) concepts:** 0
+- **Finding:** The proposal's `--lint-fix` mode to "prune excessive concepts" solves a non-existent problem. The users are disciplined here.
+
+---
+
+## 2. Link & Reference Health
+
+The graph integrity is degraded, primarily due to "orphaned" documents that exist in the filesystem but are disconnected from the graph.
+
+### The Numbers
+- **Total `depends_on` edges:** 301
+- **Broken links:** 48 (16% failure rate)
+- **Total `impacts` edges:** 118
+- **Broken impacts:** 13 (11% failure rate)
+- **Orphaned Documents:** 237 (40% of library)
+
+### Broken Link Examples (Dangling Pointers)
+These active documents point to IDs that do not exist:
+1. `v3_2_chief_architect_response` → `v3_2_spec_review_consolidation` (Missing)
+2. `v3_2_final_approval_chief_architect` → `v3_2_code_verification_codex` (Missing)
+3. `claude_v2_9_implementation_review_v3` → `v2_9_implementation_plan` (Likely renamed or moved)
+4. `v2_9_4_implementation_plan_review_gemini` → `v2_9_implementation_plan`
+
+### Orphan Analysis
+The 237 orphans include critical documentation:
+- `ontos_context_map` (The map itself!)
+- `ontos_changelog`
+- `ontos_technical_architecture_map_codex`
+- Most `archive/logs/*` are orphans (expected if `impacts` references them, but `depends_on` usually doesn't).
+
+### Link Formats
+- **Standard Markdown:** 100% of body links.
+- **Wikilinks `[[...]]`:** 0% usage in content. Found only in reference documentation *describing* the feature.
+- **Bare IDs:** Used exclusively in `depends_on` / `impacts`.
+
+---
+
+## 3. Obsidian Compatibility Gap Analysis
+
+The proposal's `--obsidian` mode is a **greenfield migration**, not a retrofit. The library currently has **zero** Obsidian optimization.
+
+### Gap Assessment
+- **Aliases:** 0 documents have `aliases`.
+- **Tags:** 0 documents use `#tag` syntax for categorization (grep matches were only comments/code).
+- **Wikilinks:** 0 documents use `[[wikilinks]]`.
+
+### Implication
+`ontos retrofit --obsidian` will not be "fixing" broken Obsidian links; it will be **rewriting the entire library's linking structure**.
+- **Risk:** High. Converting standard markdown links `[Title](path.md)` to wikilinks `[[ID]]` requires perfect ID-to-Path resolution. Given the 48 broken links, this conversion *will* fail or produce broken wikilinks for 16% of edges.
+
+---
+
+## 4. Maintenance Pain Points (Reality vs. Proposal)
+
+### 1. The "Untagged" Iceberg
+39% of the library (230 files) has no frontmatter. These files are invisible to the graph.
+- **Proposal Miss:** `retrofit` assumes files have frontmatter to standardize. It does not address the 230 files that need `ontos init --scaffold` (or equivalent).
+
+### 2. Broken Reference Chains
+48 broken links mean the graph is disconnected at key strategic points (e.g., v3.2 approvals pointing to missing verification docs).
+- **Proposal Hit:** `link-check` is **essential**. It identifies these 48 specific failures.
+
+### 3. "Concepts" are NOT the problem
+The proposal suggests auto-pruning excessive concepts.
+- **Reality:** Max concept count is 8. This feature fixes nothing.
+
+### 4. Field Ordering is Chaos
+We detected **27 distinct field orderings** across 363 files.
+- **Proposal Hit:** `retrofit --standardize` is highly relevant. The lack of consistency makes manual reading/editing of frontmatter cognitive load heavy.
+
+---
+
+## 5. Priority Assessment
+
+| Question | Answer |
+|----------|--------|
+| **Biggest Problem?** | **Graph Disconnection.** 40% orphans + 16% broken links means the "Knowledge Graph" is barely a graph. |
+| **Does `retrofit` fix it?** | **No.** `retrofit` polishes existing metadata. It does not fix broken links or tag untagged files. |
+| **What does it miss?** | **Scaffolding.** The 230 untagged files need to be brought into the fold. |
+| **One automated fix?** | **`ontos link-check` (Diagnostic) -> `ontos fix-links` (Action).** We need to find *where* those broken links go (renamed? deleted?) and patch them. |
+| **Is `link-check` justified?** | **YES.** 48 broken links across critical strategy docs is a red alert. Manual inspection is impossible at this scale. |
+
+---
+
+## 6. Recommendations
+
+### 1. Descope `--lint-fix` (Concept Pruning)
+Data shows this is unnecessary (max 8 concepts). Don't build code for a non-existent problem.
+
+### 2. Promote `link-check` to P0
+The library's referential integrity is compromised (48 broken links). This tool provides immediate value.
+
+### 3. Refine `retrofit --obsidian`
+Since usage is currently 0%, this command is a **Mass Migration**.
+- **Constraint:** Ensure it can be run *incrementally* or *dry-run* first. Converting 593 files at once is high risk.
+- **Requirement:** Must handle the 48 broken links gracefully (don't generate `[[None]]`).
+
+### 4. New "Quick Win": `ontos census` or `ontos status`
+Users need visibility into the "39% untagged" statistic. A simple command showing graph coverage would drive adoption of `ontos scaffold`.
+
+### 5. `ontos rename` is High Value
+The presence of broken links like `claude_v2_9...` -> `v2_9_implementation_plan` suggests documents are being renamed/moved without updating references. An atomic rename command would prevent future broken links.

+# v3.2.4 Discovery: Design & Risk Analysis Report
+
+> **Design Analyst Report** | Generated 2026-02-10
+> Grounded in codebase inspection of Ontos v3.2.3 (commit `631e15c`)
+
+---
+
+## Executive Summary
+
+The v3.2.4 proposal (`interop_maintenance_discussion.md`) identifies a real problem — documents drift, links break, the graph accumulates entropy — but several of its proposed solutions are mis-scoped, redundant with existing infrastructure, or solve problems that don't actually exist in the current library. This report provides concrete evidence for each claim.
+
+**Key findings:**
+
+1. **`ontos link-check` is ~90% already built.** The `ontos maintain` command (task 7: `check_links`) already calls `build_graph()` and reports broken `depends_on` references. A standalone `link-check` is a thin wrapper, not a new feature.
+2. **`retrofit --lint-fix` proposes to fill `summary` fields — but no document in the library uses `summary`.** Zero occurrences across 580 documents. This mode is solving a non-problem.
+3. **`retrofit --obsidian` duplicates `ontos map --obsidian`**, which already generates wikilinks and tags. The proposal conflates *output format* (how the context map renders) with *source format* (rewriting the actual documents).
+4. **`ontos rename` is the only genuinely new capability** with no existing equivalent, and it has real infrastructure support via `SessionContext`.
+5. **The 38 errors from `ontos map` are the real pain point** — broken `depends_on` references are the actual maintenance burden, not formatting inconsistencies.
+
+---
+
+## 1. User-Facing Design Analysis
+
+### 1.1 Command Taxonomy Fit
+
+The CLI currently has 21 primary commands organized into loose functional groups:
+
+| Group | Commands | Pattern |
+|-------|----------|---------|
+| **Setup** | `init`, `scaffold`, `stub` | Create/bootstrap |
+| **Generate** | `map`, `agents`, `export data`, `export claude` | Produce artifacts |
+| **Maintain** | `maintain`, `consolidate`, `promote`, `verify` | Library upkeep |
+| **Diagnose** | `doctor`, `query` | Inspect state |
+| **Migrate** | `schema-migrate`, `migrate`, `migration-report` | Schema evolution |
+| **Session** | `log`, `env` | Runtime context |
+
+**Assessment of proposed commands:**
+
+- **`ontos link-check`** — Fits the **Diagnose** group, but overlaps with `doctor` (health checks) and `maintain` (task 7: `check_links` at `maintain.py:549-578`). Adding a third place to check links fragments the user's mental model.
+- **`ontos rename`** — Genuinely new. Fits **Maintain** group. No existing equivalent.
+- **`ontos retrofit`** — An overloaded command trying to do three unrelated things (Obsidian interop, formatting, linting). This is a different paradigm from the existing CLI, where each command does one thing.
+
+**Recommendation:** `retrofit` should not be a single command with mode flags. The three modes have different risk profiles, different use cases, and different target users. If any are worth building, they should be separate.
+
+### 1.2 The `ontos doctor` Question
+
+**`ontos doctor` exists** (`ontos/commands/doctor.py`, 590 lines). It runs 9 health checks:
+
+1. Configuration (.ontos.toml)
+2. Git hooks
+3. Python version
+4. Docs directory
+5. Context map existence
+6. Validation (first 50 files)
+7. CLI availability
+8. AGENTS.md staleness
+9. Environment manifests
+
+**`doctor` is diagnostic, not curative.** It reports problems but doesn't fix them. The proposal's question "should these be part of `ontos doctor`?" conflates two different concerns:
+
+- **Detection** (doctor's job): "You have 38 broken links" → already done
+- **Repair** (new capability): "Fix those 38 broken links automatically" → not implemented
+
+The backlog already tracks `F-M4: doctor --repair` as a planned feature. The right answer is: **link detection stays in `doctor`/`maintain`; link *repair* is a new capability that belongs in `maintain` as a new task, not a separate command.**
+
+### 1.3 Dry-Run & Reversibility Precedent
+
+The codebase has a **strong dry-run precedent** in 4 commands:
+
+| Command | Flag | Default | Notes |
+|---------|------|---------|-------|
+| `maintain` | `--dry-run/-n` | Off | Reports what tasks would run |
+| `scaffold` | `--dry-run` | **On** (must `--apply`) | Preview-first: safe default |
+| `schema-migrate` | `--dry-run/-n` | Off | Preview schema changes |
+| `consolidate` | `--dry-run/-n` | Off | Preview archive operations |
+
+**`scaffold` is the best precedent for `retrofit`-like operations**: it defaults to dry-run and requires `--apply` to actually modify files. Any command that modifies 300+ documents should follow this pattern.
+
+**Backup pattern:** The codebase uses `.bak` files (`agents.py:314-318`) for individual file backups. For bulk operations, `SessionContext` (`core/context.py:38-199`) provides two-phase commit with rollback:
+
+```
+Phase 1: Write all changes to .tmp files
+Phase 2: Atomic rename .tmp → final (POSIX atomic)
+Failure: Clean up .tmp files, raise error
+```
+
+**What's missing:** `SessionContext` handles atomicity (all-or-nothing) but not *undo* (reverting after a successful commit). For a command that touches 300 files, the user needs the ability to revert. Options:
+
+1. Git-based undo (check dirty state, tell user to `git checkout .`)
+2. Generate a `.bak` directory before operations
+3. Require clean git state before running (safest)
+
+**Recommendation:** Require clean git working tree. Users can `git diff` to review and `git checkout .` to revert. This costs nothing to implement and leverages existing tooling.
+
+### 1.4 Progressive Disclosure
+
+The existing CLI uses two patterns for complexity:
+
+- **Flags on a single command** (e.g., `map --obsidian --compact --filter`)  — when the flags modify *the same operation*
+- **Separate commands** (e.g., `doctor` vs `maintain` vs `verify`) — when the operations are fundamentally different
+
+`retrofit --obsidian`, `--standardize`, and `--lint-fix` are fundamentally different operations with different risk profiles. Combining them into one command with flags creates a confusing blast radius question: what does `ontos retrofit` with no flags do? All three? Nothing?
+
+---
+
+## 2. Data Integrity & Risk Analysis
+
+### 2.1 What Documents Actually Look Like
+
+Examined 8 documents across all categories. Key observations:
+
+**Minimal frontmatter (majority of documents):**
+```yaml
+---
+id: ontos_manual
+type: kernel
+status: active
+depends_on: []
+---
+```
+
+**Extended frontmatter (log documents):**
+```yaml
+---
+id: log_20260210_v3-2-3-final-merge-release-wrap
+type: log
+status: active
+event_type: release
+source: codex
+branch: main
+created: 2026-02-10
+---
+```
+
+**Critical variation:**
+- Release docs (`docs/releases/v3.2.3.md`) have **no frontmatter at all**
+- Template (`docs/_template.md`) has **YAML comments** explaining fields
+- Generated docs (`docs/reference/ontology_spec.md`) have "DO NOT EDIT" markers
+- Field counts range from 3 fields (minimal) to 10+ fields (logs)
+
+### 2.2 Frontmatter Fragility
+
+**Serialization pipeline** (`core/schema.py:295-387`):
+- `serialize_frontmatter()` uses a hardcoded `field_order` list
+- Outputs fields in deterministic order: `id`, `type`, `status`, `ontos_schema`, `curation_level`, `depends_on`, `concepts`, ...
+- Remaining fields (not in list) appended in dict iteration order
+
+**What gets destroyed on round-trip:**
+
+| Feature | Preserved? | Evidence |
+|---------|-----------|---------|
+| Field values | Yes | Values survive parse → serialize |
+| Field order | **Reordered** | Forced to `field_order` list (`schema.py:315-319`) |
+| YAML comments | **Stripped** | PyYAML `safe_load()` discards comments; fallback parser skips `#` lines (`frontmatter.py:100`) |
+| Blank lines in frontmatter | **Stripped** | Neither PyYAML nor stdlib serializer preserves them |
+| Inline vs block list format | **Normalized** | Short lists become `[a, b]`; complex lists become multi-line (`schema.py:358-366`) |
+| Quote style | **Normalized** | Only quoted when containing `:` or `{` (`schema.py:370-371`) |
+
+**Implication for `retrofit --standardize`:** This mode would *already happen as a side effect* of any operation that round-trips frontmatter through `serialize_frontmatter()`. The `promote`, `verify`, and `scaffold` commands already enforce field order when they write. A standalone `--standardize` mode is redundant — it's just a round-trip through the existing serializer.
+
+**Corruption risk:** The template file (`docs/_template.md`) contains YAML comments like `# Underscore prefix marks this as internal`. These would be silently destroyed. Any document where a user has added explanatory comments in frontmatter loses them permanently.
+
+### 2.3 Link Format Diversity
+
+Five distinct linking patterns exist in the library:
+
+| # | Pattern | Example | Where | Count |
+|---|---------|---------|-------|-------|
+| 1 | **Bare ID in frontmatter** | `depends_on: [auth_flow]` | All docs | Primary mechanism |
+| 2 | **Bare ID in impacts** | `impacts: [v2_strategy]` | Log docs | Secondary |
+| 3 | **Markdown links** | `[Manual](Ontos_Manual.md)` | Reference docs, agent instructions | Moderate |
+| 4 | **Wikilinks** | `[[ontology_spec]]` | Generated by `map --obsidian` only | Output-only |
+| 5 | **Aliases** | Auto-generated from ID | Validation suggestions | Internal |
+
+**Critical finding for `retrofit --obsidian`:** The proposal wants to convert markdown links in document *source* to wikilinks. But wikilinks currently exist only in *generated output* (the context map via `--obsidian` flag). Converting source documents would:
+
+1. Break standard markdown rendering (GitHub, VS Code preview, any non-Obsidian tool)
+2. Be irreversible without git — there's no "unconvert" mode
+3. Create a divergence between Obsidian users and non-Obsidian users
+
+The existing `ontos map --obsidian` flag is the correct architecture: generate Obsidian-compatible *output* without mutating *source*. The proposal inverts this.
+
+### 2.4 Atomicity Analysis
+
+**`ontos rename` across 50 files — what happens on failure at file 31?**
+
+`SessionContext` (`core/context.py:132-202`) provides two-phase commit:
+
+```python
+def commit(self) -> List[Path]:
+    # Phase 1: Write to temp files (.tmp suffix)
+    for write in self.pending_writes:
+        tmp_path = write.path.with_suffix(write.path.suffix + '.tmp')
+        tmp_path.write_text(write.content)
+        temp_files.append((tmp_path, write.path))
+
+    # Phase 2: Atomic rename
+    for tmp, final in temp_files:
+        tmp.rename(final)  # POSIX atomic
+```
+
+**If Phase 1 fails** (e.g., permission error on file 31): All `.tmp` files are cleaned up. No source files modified. Safe.
+
+**If Phase 2 fails** (e.g., disk full on rename 31): Files 1-30 have been renamed (committed). Files 31-50 still have old content. **Partial commit — inconsistent state.** This is the real risk.
+
+**Mitigation:** The code has cleanup logic that removes temp files on failure, but once an atomic rename succeeds, it's committed. For `ontos rename`, this means: if the rename succeeds for 30 documents' frontmatter but fails on document 31, you have 30 files with the new ID and 20 files with the old ID in their `depends_on`. The graph is now broken in a *different* way than before.
+
+**Recommendation:** `ontos rename` should:
+1. Require clean git state (so `git checkout .` reverts everything)
+2. Load all files into memory first, validate the entire rename is possible
+3. Only then commit — fail fast before any writes, not during
+
+### 2.5 The Corruption Question — Concrete Examples
+
+**Scenario 1: Naive find-and-replace for `ontos rename old_id new_id`**
+
+Document `docs/reference/Ontos_Manual.md` contains 24 `---` markers and YAML code examples:
+
+```yaml
+depends_on: [parent_id]
+```
+
+A naive regex replacing `parent_id` inside code blocks would corrupt documentation examples. The rename must only operate on:
+- Parsed frontmatter `depends_on` lists (not raw text)
+- Parsed frontmatter `impacts` lists
+- Possibly markdown link targets (but NOT inside code fences)
+
+**Scenario 2: Round-tripping the template file**
+
+`docs/_template.md` frontmatter:
+```yaml
+id: _template         # Underscore prefix marks this as internal
+type: atom            # REQUIRED. Options: kernel, strategy, product, atom
+status: draft         # Optional. Options: draft, active, deprecated
+owner: null           # Optional. Role responsible for this doc.
+depends_on: []        # List of dependency IDs.
+```
+
+After `serialize_frontmatter()`:
+```yaml
+id: _template
+type: atom
+status: draft
+depends_on: []
+owner: null
+```
+
+All comments are destroyed. The field `owner` moves to after `depends_on` (field_order list puts `depends_on` before unlisted fields). **This is destructive to documentation value.**
+
+**Scenario 3: Obsidian wikilink conversion inside code blocks**
+
+`Ontos_Manual.md` contains embedded YAML examples. A wikilink converter that doesn't skip fenced code blocks would convert:
+```markdown
+`depends_on: [auth_flow]`  →  `depends_on: [[[auth_flow]]]`
+```
+
+This is syntactically broken in both markdown and YAML.
+
+---
+
+## 3. Graph Model Assessment
+
+### 3.1 The Graph in Code
+
+**Formal data structures exist** (`core/graph.py:18-32`):
+
+```python
+@dataclass
+class DependencyGraph:
+    nodes: Dict[str, GraphNode]           # id → node
+    edges: Dict[str, List[str]]           # id → depends_on
+    reverse_edges: Dict[str, List[str]]   # id → depended_by
+```
+
+**The graph is ephemeral** — reconstructed from frontmatter on every `ontos map` invocation. There is no persistent graph store. This is fine at 580 documents (sub-second build time) but means every operation that needs graph context must re-scan the entire library.
+
+### 3.2 `depends_on` Validation
+
+**Already comprehensive** (`graph.py:44-83`):
+
+1. `build_graph()` checks every `depends_on` reference against `existing_ids`
+2. Missing references generate `BROKEN_LINK` errors with severity "error"
+3. Fuzzy suggestion engine (`suggestions.py:172-224`) proposes fixes using:
+   - Substring matching (confidence: 0.85)
+   - Alias matching (confidence: 0.85)
+   - Levenshtein distance (variable confidence, threshold: 0.5)
+4. Top 3 candidates returned, sorted by confidence
+
+**What's NOT validated:**
+- `impacts` references (validated separately in `validation.py:155-169` but only as warnings)
+- Markdown link targets (not parsed from body content at all)
+- External URLs (not checked)
+
+### 3.3 Infrastructure Available for `link-check`
+
+| Capability | Status | Location |
+|-----------|--------|----------|
+| Build full dependency graph | Done | `graph.py:build_graph()` |
+| Detect broken `depends_on` | Done | `graph.py:64-81` |
+| Detect cycles | Done | `graph.py:detect_cycles()` |
+| Detect orphans | Done | `graph.py:detect_orphans()` |
+| Calculate depth | Done | `graph.py:calculate_depths()` |
+| Suggest fixes for broken links | Done | `suggestions.py:172-224` |
+| Collect all validation errors | Done | `validation.py:ValidationOrchestrator` |
+| Report errors with context | Done | `map.py:_generate_validation_section()` |
+| Run as maintain task | Done | `maintain.py:549-578` (`check_links` task) |
+| Standalone CLI command | **Not done** | Would need registration in `cli.py` |
+
+**Assessment:** A standalone `ontos link-check` command is approximately 40 lines of new code: register the subparser in `cli.py`, create a handler that calls `build_graph()` + `detect_cycles()` + `detect_orphans()`, and format output. The hard work is already done.
+
+### 3.4 Graph as Data Model vs File-System Artifact
+
+The graph exists in two forms:
+
+1. **Source of truth:** Frontmatter `depends_on` fields in individual `.md` files (file-system artifact)
+2. **Derived view:** `DependencyGraph` object built in memory (data model, ephemeral)
+
+There is no third form (no database, no index file, no cache of the graph). The context map (`Ontos_Context_Map.md`) is a *rendered view*, not a queryable store.
+
+**Implication for `ontos rename`:** The rename must modify the *source of truth* (frontmatter in files), not a derived data structure. This means:
+1. Scan all documents (already done by `scan_documents()`)
+2. Parse all frontmatter (already done by `load_document_from_content()`)
+3. Find all references to `old_id` in `depends_on` and `impacts` arrays
+4. Rewrite those arrays with `new_id`
+5. Update the renamed document's own `id` field
+6. Commit atomically via `SessionContext`
+
+Steps 1-4 require no new infrastructure. Step 5-6 follow the `promote`/`verify` pattern.
+
+---
+
+## 4. Scope Recommendation
+
+### 4.1 What's the Actual Problem?
+
+The proposal conflates three distinct problems:
+
+| Problem | Evidence | Severity |
+|---------|----------|----------|
+| **Broken links** | 38 errors from `ontos map` — all `BROKEN_LINK` type | **High** — blocks strict mode, erodes trust in graph |
+| **Document drift** | 300 warnings (orphans, staleness, missing fields) | **Medium** — informational, not blocking |
+| **Format inconsistency** | Frontmatter field order varies, some docs lack frontmatter | **Low** — cosmetic; existing tools handle variation gracefully |
+
+The core pain point is **graph integrity** (broken links), not interoperability or formatting. The 38 errors are the problem users actually encounter. The 300 warnings are noise that the system already tolerates.
+
+### 4.2 Minimum Viable v3.2.4
+
+**Ship these two things:**
+
+#### 1. `ontos link-check` (standalone diagnostic)
+
+Extract the existing `check_links` logic from `maintain.py` into a dedicated command with better output:
+
+- Full broken-link report (not capped at 5 like the maintain task)
+- Include fix suggestions (already generated by `suggest_candidates_for_broken_ref`)
+- Include orphan report
+- Support `--json` for machine consumption
+- Exit code: 0 = clean, 1 = broken links found
+
+**Effort:** ~100 lines (command registration + handler + output formatting). All graph infrastructure exists.
+
+**Why standalone command, not just `maintain`:** Users want to check links *without* running all 8 maintenance tasks. The maintain task caps output at 5 broken links. A diagnostic tool should show everything.
+
+#### 2. `ontos rename <old_id> <new_id>` (atomic rename)
+
+New capability with no existing equivalent. Implementation:
+
+- Require clean git working tree (abort if dirty)
+- Default to dry-run (`--apply` to execute, following `scaffold` precedent)
+- Update: target document's `id` field, all `depends_on` arrays, all `impacts` arrays
+- Use `SessionContext` for atomic commit
+- Report all files that would be / were modified
+
+**Effort:** ~200-300 lines. Requires new command module, uses existing `SessionContext`, `build_graph()`, `serialize_frontmatter()`.
+
+**Scope limit:** v3.2.4 should handle ID rename only (frontmatter fields). File/directory moves are a separate, harder problem — defer to v3.3.
+
+### 4.3 What Should Be Deferred
+
+| Feature | Reason to Defer |
+|---------|----------------|
+| `retrofit --obsidian` | `ontos map --obsidian` already handles output-side interop. Source-side wikilink conversion breaks non-Obsidian tools and is irreversible. If users want Obsidian source compatibility, this needs a separate design discussion about the tradeoff. |
+| `retrofit --standardize` | Frontmatter order is already enforced by `serialize_frontmatter()` whenever any command writes. A standalone "reformat everything" command has no user-facing benefit and risks destroying YAML comments. |
+| `retrofit --lint-fix` (summary fill) | **`summary` is not used anywhere.** Zero occurrences across 580 documents in `docs/`, 2 occurrences in a single archived v2 doc. There is no code that reads a `summary` field. This is a feature for a field that doesn't exist. |
+| `retrofit --lint-fix` (concept pruning) | "Excessive concepts" is subjective. No heuristic is given. Auto-pruning semantic metadata requires understanding content — this is an LLM task, not a CLI task. |
+| External URL health checking | Out of scope for a documentation graph tool. Existing tools (linkchecker, markdown-link-check) do this better. |
+| `doctor --repair` | Good idea but needs its own design pass. Repair actions have different risk profiles per check type. |
+| Directory moves with rename | File moves change `filepath` references in the graph, config paths, and potentially import patterns. Much harder than ID rename. Defer. |
+
+### 4.4 What's Missing from the Proposal
+
+**1. `ontos fix-links` (or `rename` with `--auto` mode)**
+
+The 38 broken links already have fix suggestions with confidence scores. A command that auto-applies high-confidence fixes (e.g., `ontos fix-links --confidence 0.85 --apply`) would directly address the #1 pain point. This is more valuable than any `retrofit` mode.
+
+**2. Frontmatter-safe editing**
+
+Every command that modifies frontmatter destroys YAML comments. Before adding more write commands (`retrofit`, `rename`), the serializer should be made comment-preserving — or the project should formally document that YAML comments in frontmatter are not supported. Currently it's an undocumented gotcha.
+
+**3. Pre-operation validation for `rename`**
+
+The proposal doesn't discuss: what if `new_id` already exists? What if `old_id` is referenced in markdown body text (not just frontmatter)? What about the context map itself (which contains rendered references)? These edge cases need explicit handling.
+
+---
+
+## 5. Design Alternatives
+
+| Proposed | Problem | Alternative | Why Better |
+|----------|---------|-------------|------------|
+| `ontos retrofit` (3 modes in 1 command) | Overloaded: different risk profiles, different users, different purposes | Split into separate concerns or absorb into existing commands | Each operation gets its own dry-run, its own documentation, its own risk assessment |
+| `retrofit --obsidian` (convert source to wikilinks) | Breaks non-Obsidian tools; `map --obsidian` already exists for output | Keep source as standard markdown; enhance `map --obsidian` if needed | Non-destructive; works for all users, not just Obsidian users |
+| `retrofit --standardize` (reorder frontmatter) | Already happens as side effect of any write command; destroys comments | Document the `field_order` convention; don't force-rewrite all files | Avoids unnecessary churn and comment loss |
+| `retrofit --lint-fix` (fill `summary`) | `summary` field doesn't exist in any document; no code reads it | Remove from proposal; if summaries are wanted, design the field first, then the filler | Don't build automation for a schema that doesn't exist yet |
+| `link-check` as new command | 90% overlap with `maintain check_links` task | Standalone command that reuses `build_graph()` but with full output (not capped at 5) | Minimal new code; leverages existing infrastructure completely |
+| `rename` with implicit apply | Modifies 50+ files with no preview | Default to dry-run; require `--apply` (like `scaffold`) | Follows existing precedent; prevents accidents |
+| `rename` handling file moves | Directory moves are coupled with ID rename | ID-only rename in v3.2.4; file moves deferred to v3.3 | Reduces scope; ID rename alone is useful and safe |

+# v3.2.4 Discovery: Feasibility & Architecture Report
+
+## 1. Existing Infrastructure Map
+
+### 1.1 CLI command structure (entry points, parsing, registration)
+
+| Finding | Evidence |
+|---|---|
+| CLI entrypoint is `python -m ontos` -> `ontos.cli:main`. | `ontos/__main__.py` imports `main` and exits with it (`ontos/__main__.py:10-13`). |
+| Subcommands are registered centrally in `create_parser()` via `_register_*` functions. | `create_parser()` builds subparsers and registers commands (`ontos/cli.py:31-89`), with registrations such as `_register_map`, `_register_maintain`, `_register_query` (`ontos/cli.py:64-80`). |
+| Command handlers follow a stable pattern: build `*Options` dataclass, call `*_command`. | `_cmd_map` -> `MapOptions` -> `map_command` (`ontos/cli.py:549-565`), `_cmd_maintain` -> `MaintainOptions` -> `maintain_command` (`ontos/cli.py:614-627`), `_cmd_query` -> `QueryOptions` -> `query_command` (`ontos/cli.py:934-950`). |
+| Dispatch is generic: parsed `args.func(args)` with common exception handling. | `main()` parses args and routes to `args.func` (`ontos/cli.py:1013-1057`). |
+| Proposed commands are not currently first-class commands (`retrofit`, `rename`, `link-check`). | Current registered command set in parser/CLI tests does not include those names (`ontos/cli.py:64-80`, `tests/test_cli.py:67-70`, `tests/test_cli.py:146-148`). |
+
+### 1.2 Frontmatter parsing/writing and field-order behavior
+
+| Finding | Evidence |
+|---|---|
+| There are two parsing paths: `core.frontmatter.parse_frontmatter()` and IO YAML parser (`parse_frontmatter_content()`). | `parse_frontmatter()` in core (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:23-76`); IO parser contract in `parse_frontmatter_content()` (`ontos/io/yaml.py:77-107`). |
+| Fallback parser is intentionally shallow (line-by-line, inline lists only) and silently skips non-`key: value` lines. | `_fallback_yaml_parse()` skips lines without `:` (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:98-104`), supports inline list only (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:118-122`). |
+| YAML parsing uses `yaml.safe_load` in IO layer. | `parse_yaml()` uses `yaml.safe_load` (`ontos/io/yaml.py:10`, `ontos/io/yaml.py:14-30`). |
+| Validation checks required fields but not frontmatter key order. | `validate_frontmatter()` required-field checks only (`ontos/core/schema.py:255-292`). |
+| Serialization enforces an explicit field order. | `serialize_frontmatter()` defines `field_order` and emits ordered keys first (`ontos/core/schema.py:295-333`, especially `ontos/core/schema.py:315-319`). |
+| Existing write commands already rely on this serializer. | `scaffold` (`ontos/commands/scaffold.py:9`, `ontos/commands/scaffold.py:111-114`), `promote` (`ontos/commands/promote.py:8`, `ontos/commands/promote.py:136-139`), `stub` (`ontos/commands/stub.py:8`, `ontos/commands/stub.py:72-92`), `migrate` (`ontos/commands/migrate.py:7-11`, `ontos/commands/migrate.py:130-133`). |
+
+### 1.3 Cross-reference resolution (`depends_on`, links), graph model vs ad-hoc
+
+| Finding | Evidence |
+|---|---|
+| There is a core graph model (`DependencyGraph`) used for dependency integrity. | Model and edges/reverse edges in `DependencyGraph` (`ontos/core/graph.py:28-42`). |
+| Core `build_graph()` resolves only `depends_on` references and emits broken-link errors for missing IDs. | `build_graph()` loops `doc.depends_on` and checks against `existing_ids` (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`), emits `BROKEN_LINK` errors (`ontos/core/graph.py:74-83`). |
+| Validation orchestration uses that graph for broken links, cycles, orphans, depth. | `ValidationOrchestrator.validate_graph()` (`ontos/core/validation.py:88-133`). |
+| Additional cross-reference checks exist for `impacts` and `describes`, but not markdown body links. | `validate_impacts()` (`ontos/core/validation.py:155-169`), `validate_describes()` (`ontos/core/validation.py:171-178`). |
+| `query` has its own ad-hoc graph builder instead of reusing `ontos.core.graph`. | `query.build_graph()` uses local dict/defaultdict graph (`ontos/commands/query.py:58-69`). |
+| Existing maintain “link check” only checks broken `depends_on` via `build_graph()`. | `_task_check_links()` calls `build_graph(docs)` and reports `broken_links` count (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`). |
+
+### 1.4 What v3.1.0 Obsidian compatibility delivered vs assumptions
+
+| Finding | Evidence |
+|---|---|
+| v3.1 spec explicitly deferred retrofit/body-link conversion to v3.2.x. | Out-of-scope includes “Retrofit 314 existing documents” and “Wikilinks in document body” (`.ontos-internal/strategy/v3.1/V3.1.0-Obsidian-Compatibility-Spec.md:45-53`). |
+| Implemented runtime behavior is mostly map output formatting (`--obsidian` affects document link formatting). | CLI flag exists (`ontos/cli.py:121-123`); map document table uses `_format_doc_link(..., obsidian_mode)` (`ontos/commands/map.py:355-382`), formatter emits `[[...]]` (`ontos/commands/map.py:561-580`). |
+| Dependency tree output is not wikilink-formatted. | `_generate_dependency_tree()` prints plain IDs (`ontos/commands/map.py:415-441`). |
+| `tags`/`aliases` support exists as normalized load-time fields, not bulk retrofit writes. | `normalize_tags/normalize_aliases` (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:242-302`), used during load (`ontos/io/files.py:139-165`). |
+| Obsidian tests validate link formatting + lenient read, not bulk transformation. | `tests/commands/test_map_obsidian.py:3-55`. |
+| `map --obsidian` help text mentions tags, but map generation code has no `tags`/`aliases` output path. | Help string says “wikilinks, tags” (`ontos/cli.py:121-123`), no tags/aliases handling in map table/tree generation (`ontos/commands/map.py:355-382`, `ontos/commands/map.py:415-441`, `ontos/commands/map.py:561-580`). |
+
+### 1.5 Document enumeration (“walk the library”) utilities
+
+| Finding | Evidence |
+|---|---|
+| Shared walker exists: `scan_documents(dirs, skip_patterns)`. | `ontos/io/files.py:60-90`. |
+| `map` scans `docs_dir + scan_paths` from config (not root by default). | `scan_dirs = [docs_dir] + scan_paths` (`ontos/commands/map.py:709-714`). |
+| `maintain` uses the same docs+scan_paths model. | `_scan_dirs()` and `_scan_docs()` (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:232-243`). |
+| `query` scans from root by default (broader and different behavior). | `scan_documents([root], ...)` (`ontos/commands/query.py:31-37`), default `search_dir = root` (`ontos/commands/query.py:185-188`). |
+| `snapshot`/migration tooling explicitly scans both `docs/` and `.ontos-internal/`. | `create_snapshot()` scan dirs (`ontos/core/snapshot.py:115-127`). |
+| Default config has empty `scan_paths`, so command coverage depends heavily on command choice/config. | `scan_paths` default empty (`ontos/core/config.py:51-57`), project `.ontos.toml` omits `scan_paths` (`.ontos.toml:10-12`). |
+
+## 2. Feasibility Assessment per Feature
+
+### 2.1 `ontos retrofit` (by mode)
+
+| Mode | Reuse candidates | New code needed (scope) | Hardest part | Dependency risks | Blast radius |
+|---|---|---|---|---|---|
+| `--standardize` | `scan_documents` walker (`ontos/io/files.py:60-90`), parser+serializer (`ontos/io/yaml.py:77-107`, `ontos/core/schema.py:295-333`), transactional writes (`ontos/core/context.py:95-203`), existing rewrite precedent in migrate/scaffold/promote (`ontos/commands/migrate.py:123-142`, `ontos/commands/scaffold.py:111-114`, `ontos/commands/promote.py:136-139`). | Mostly orchestration CLI + rewrite loop + dry-run/report. **Medium** (~150-300 LOC). | Avoiding parse drift across parser paths (`parse_frontmatter` vs `parse_frontmatter_content`) and preserving body safely (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:23-76`, `ontos/io/yaml.py:77-107`). | Low-to-medium if implemented as command-layer utility; touching parser core increases risk. | Medium: mass frontmatter rewrite; generally recoverable via git, but broad diff churn. |
+| `--lint-fix` | Existing lint thresholds/rules are discoverable (`ontos/commands/map.py:493-520`), and rewrite pipeline exists (`ontos/core/schema.py:295-333`, `ontos/core/context.py:95-203`). | Need pruning policy, deterministic concept selection, summary generation policy, and opt-outs. **Medium-Large** (~250-500 LOC). | “Fill missing summary” is underspecified because `summary` is not a schema/ontology field and existing summary extraction is inconsistent/log-centric (`ontos/core/schema.py:38-58`, `ontos/core/ontology.py:104-176`, `ontos/commands/consolidate.py:73-88`, `ontos/core/history.py:105-120`). | Medium-high: adding new implicit metadata rules can conflict with curation workflows. | High: writes many docs; semantic corruption risk if auto-prune/summary heuristics are wrong. |
+| `--obsidian` | Existing pieces: tag/alias normalization (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:242-302`, `ontos/io/files.py:162-165`), wikilink format helper (`ontos/commands/map.py:561-580`), lenient reader (`ontos/io/obsidian.py:10-36`). | Needs full content-link rewrite engine, reversible migration metadata, collision handling, and bulk write orchestration. **Large** (500+ LOC). | Body link conversion has no existing parser/rewrite infrastructure; current graph/link logic is frontmatter-centric (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`, `ontos/core/validation.py:88-133`). | High: likely touches parsing/writing and command orchestration across many modules. | Very high: body/link corruption across library if rewrite rules are imperfect. |
+
+### 2.2 `ontos rename <old_id> <new_id>`
+
+| Question | Assessment |
+|---|---|
+| Reuse candidates | Graph + missing-ref logic (`ontos/core/graph.py:44-83`), library walkers (`ontos/io/files.py:60-90`, `ontos/commands/map.py:709-714`, `ontos/core/snapshot.py:115-127`), transactional writes/moves (`ontos/core/context.py:119-203`), report generation precedent (`ontos/commands/migration_report.py:27-127`, `ontos/commands/migration_report.py:160-199`). |
+| New code needed (scope) | Cross-reference indexer/rewrite engine for `depends_on`, `impacts`, `describes`, and any body-link formats; collision and idempotency checks; dry-run report; optional move logic. **Large** (500+ LOC). |
+| Hardest part | Safe global rewrite without false positives plus ID-collision prevention. Current loaders overwrite duplicate IDs silently (`docs[doc.id] = doc`) in map/maintain/query pipelines (`ontos/commands/map.py:736-738`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:250-256`, `ontos/commands/query.py:43-45`). |
+| Dependency risks | High if parser/graph contracts are expanded to include body links; medium if kept command-local with clear adapters. |
+| Blast radius | Very high: incorrect rename can break graph integrity and historical references across many files; partial failures are hard to unwind automatically. |
+
+### 2.3 `ontos link-check`
+
+| Question | Assessment |
+|---|---|
+| Reuse candidates | Existing `check_links` task (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`), graph broken-link detection (`ontos/core/graph.py:44-83`), orphan detection helper (`ontos/core/graph.py:129-145`), validation orchestrator (`ontos/core/validation.py:72-133`). |
+| New code needed (scope) | New CLI command wrapper + output modes + broader checks (orphans, possibly impacts/describes). **Small-Medium** (~120-250 LOC) for internal refs only. |
+| Hardest part | Defining scope of “link” because existing implementation checks `depends_on` only (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:562-567`). |
+| Dependency risks | Low if read-only and built on existing graph/validation paths; medium if expanded to body-link parsing or external URL checks. |
+| Blast radius | Low (diagnostic/read-only). |
+
+## 3. The Scoping Question
+
+### 3.1 Which command has most existing infrastructure (lowest effort)?
+
+`ontos link-check` has the strongest base: a working task already exists (`_task_check_links`) and uses the core graph validator (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`, `ontos/core/graph.py:44-83`). Turning this into a standalone CLI command is mostly interface work, not new core behavior (`ontos/cli.py:31-89`, `ontos/cli.py:96-190`).
+
+### 3.2 Highest risk-to-value ratio
+
+Highest risk-to-value: `ontos retrofit --obsidian`.
+
+Reasoning:
+- v3.1 explicitly deferred retrofit/body wikilinks (`.ontos-internal/strategy/v3.1/V3.1.0-Obsidian-Compatibility-Spec.md:45-53`).
+- Current implemented obsidian support is output-formatting oriented, not content transformation (`ontos/commands/map.py:355-382`, `ontos/commands/map.py:561-580`).
+- Existing link integrity infrastructure does not parse body links (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`, `ontos/core/validation.py:88-133`).
+
+### 3.3 If shipping exactly ONE command in v3.2.4
+
+Ship `ontos link-check` first.
+
+Why:
+- Reuses existing code directly.
+- Read-only (low blast radius).
+- Creates immediate value for graph hygiene before any write-heavy automation.
+- Can later serve as guardrail for rename/retrofit rollouts.
+
+Evidence: existing check-links task and graph validators (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`, `ontos/core/graph.py:44-83`, `ontos/core/validation.py:88-133`).
+
+### 3.4 Prerequisites among commands
+
+| Dependency | Assessment |
+|---|---|
+| `link-check` prerequisite for others? | Not technically required, but operationally valuable as a pre/post validation gate for rename/retrofit. Existing read-only checks already exist (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`). |
+| `rename` prerequisite for `retrofit`? | No hard dependency. They share a missing prerequisite: a robust global reference index/rewrite engine and consistent scan scope (`ontos/commands/map.py:709-714`, `ontos/commands/query.py:31-37`, `ontos/core/snapshot.py:115-127`). |
+| Shared prerequisite | Unifying “what is the library” scan behavior and reference coverage is more important than command ordering (`ontos/core/config.py:51-57`, `.ontos.toml:10-12`, `ontos/commands/map.py:709-714`, `ontos/commands/query.py:185-188`). |
+
+## 4. Architecture Concerns
+
+### 4.1 Do these commands require core graph/data-layer changes?
+
+| Command | Core change needed? | Evidence-based rationale |
+|---|---|---|
+| `link-check` | Probably no (for v1 scope). | Existing core graph already detects broken `depends_on` and orphans (`ontos/core/graph.py:44-83`, `ontos/core/graph.py:129-145`). |
+| `rename` | Likely yes if true “all references” includes body links. | Current core graph models `depends_on` edges only (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`), and command ecosystems use mixed parsers/scope (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:23-76`, `ontos/io/yaml.py:77-107`, `ontos/commands/map.py:709-714`, `ontos/commands/query.py:31-37`). |
+| `retrofit` | `--standardize`: no core changes; `--lint-fix` and `--obsidian`: likely policy/data-model extensions. | No formal `summary` field in schema/ontology (`ontos/core/schema.py:38-58`, `ontos/core/ontology.py:104-176`); obsidian body conversion has no existing core representation. |
+
+### 4.2 Existing patterns/constraints that should guide implementation
+
+| Pattern/constraint | Evidence |
+|---|---|
+| Keep IO/parsing dependencies out of `core` where possible. | YAML wrapper explicitly isolates PyYAML in IO layer (`ontos/io/yaml.py:1-8`). |
+| Commands are thin wrappers around options dataclasses and command modules. | CLI handler pattern (`ontos/cli.py:549-627`, `ontos/cli.py:934-950`). |
+| Batch write operations should prefer `SessionContext` buffering/commit. | `SessionContext` write/move buffer and commit (`ontos/core/context.py:95-203`), used by migrate/scaffold/promote/stub (`ontos/commands/migrate.py:109-142`, `ontos/commands/scaffold.py:152-181`, `ontos/commands/promote.py:202-217`, `ontos/commands/stub.py:141-144`). |
+| Dry-run/report UX already exists and should be reused for risky commands. | `maintain --dry-run` (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:35-39`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:270-272`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:555-557`), `migrate --dry-run` (`ontos/commands/migrate.py:21-24`, `ontos/commands/migrate.py:118-121`), report generation command (`ontos/commands/migration_report.py:160-199`). |
+
+### 4.3 Potential boundary violations
+
+| Risk | Why it violates current boundaries |
+|---|---|
+| Putting body-link parsing heuristics into core graph immediately | Core graph currently models typed dependency edges from structured frontmatter, not freeform markdown parsing (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`). |
+| Adding network URL health checks into `doctor`/`link-check` without clear isolation | Current dependency set has no HTTP client dependency (`pyproject.toml:29-32`), and doctor currently performs local diagnostics only (`ontos/commands/doctor.py:51-565`). |
+| Treating “atomic rename” as solved by existing transaction helper | `SessionContext` supports move/write buffering, but failure handling does not provide full rollback for already-applied renames/writes (`ontos/core/context.py:159-203`). |
+
+## 5. What the Proposal Gets Wrong (or Doesn’t Know)
+
+1. The proposal assumes retrofit-level Obsidian transformation is close at hand; code reality is narrower.
+Evidence: v3.1 explicitly deferred retrofit/body wikilinks (`.ontos-internal/strategy/v3.1/V3.1.0-Obsidian-Compatibility-Spec.md:45-53`), while implementation mainly covers map link formatting and load-time tag/alias normalization (`ontos/commands/map.py:355-382`, `ontos/commands/map.py:561-580`, `ontos/io/files.py:162-165`).
+
+2. “`map --obsidian` includes tags” is overstated in current runtime behavior.
+Evidence: CLI help says “wikilinks, tags” (`ontos/cli.py:121-123`), but map rendering code only changes link formatting in the table and does not emit tag columns/sections (`ontos/commands/map.py:355-382`, `ontos/commands/map.py:561-580`).
+
+3. “Atomic rename across entire library” is underspecified against inconsistent scan scope and parser paths.
+Evidence: map/maintain use `docs_dir + scan_paths` (`ontos/commands/map.py:709-714`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:232-243`), query scans root (`ontos/commands/query.py:31-37`), snapshot scans docs + `.ontos-internal` (`ontos/core/snapshot.py:115-127`), default `scan_paths` is empty (`ontos/core/config.py:51-57`).
+
+4. ID-collision behavior is not addressed, but current pipelines silently overwrite same-ID docs in memory.
+Evidence: map (`ontos/commands/map.py:736-738`), maintain graph load (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:250-256`), query scan (`ontos/commands/query.py:43-45`).
+
+5. The proposal treats “summary fill” as straightforward, but `summary` is not part of canonical schema/ontology.
+Evidence: schema optional fields exclude `summary` (`ontos/core/schema.py:38-58`), ontology field definitions do not include `summary` (`ontos/core/ontology.py:104-176`). Existing summary extraction behavior is ad-hoc and inconsistent (`ontos/commands/consolidate.py:73-88`, `ontos/core/history.py:105-120`, `ontos/commands/map.py:185-190`).
+
+6. “link-check” is partially already implemented under `maintain`.
+Evidence: existing `check_links` task reports broken dependency links (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`), with tests validating that behavior (`tests/commands/test_maintain.py:203-217`).
+
+7. External URL health checks are not an incremental extension of current link checking; they introduce new concerns.
+Evidence: current link checking is dependency-ID based (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:562-567`), and project deps do not include HTTP clients (`pyproject.toml:29-32`).
+
+8. The proposal underestimates legacy-content safety risks during bulk rewrite.
+Evidence: parser behavior is mixed (strict IO YAML vs fallback parser) (`ontos/io/yaml.py:77-107`, `ontos/core/frontmatter.py:79-151`), and not all commands use lenient Obsidian read path (`ontos/io/obsidian.py:10-36`, `ontos/commands/migrate.py:114-117`, `ontos/commands/promote.py:121-137`).
+
+## Recommendation Snapshot
+
+- **Ship in v3.2.4:** `ontos link-check` (standalone command, read-only), because `check_links` already exists and is read-only over graph data (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`, `ontos/core/graph.py:44-83`).
+- **Defer:** `retrofit --obsidian` and full `rename` until reference indexing/rewrite engine + dry-run/report + collision policy are designed (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`, `ontos/commands/migration_report.py:160-199`, `ontos/commands/map.py:736-738`).
+- **Safe next increment:** add `--orphans` and optional `--include impacts,describes` to `link-check` by reusing `ValidationOrchestrator`/`detect_orphans` (`ontos/core/graph.py:129-145`, `ontos/core/validation.py:155-178`).

+
+## Assumption Attack
+
+| Assumption | Why It Might Be Wrong | Impact If Wrong |
+|------------|----------------------|-----------------|
+| Body-link zone detection (code fences, inline code) is sufficient for safe bare-ID replacement | Real IDs contain regex metacharacters (dots in `v3.0.4_Code_Review_Claude`), and `\b` word boundaries interact unpredictably with dots/hyphens. `\bv3\b` matches inside `v3.0.4_Code_Review_Claude` because `.` is a non-word character creating a boundary after `v3`. The proposal says "word-boundary-safe" but doesn't define what word boundary means for IDs containing `.`, `-`, and `_`. | False-positive rewrites corrupt unrelated references in body text. A rename of a short ID silently damages documents mentioning longer IDs that share the prefix separated by dots/hyphens. |
+| `SessionContext` + clean git is adequate failure protection | Clean git is checked before `--apply`, but `SessionContext.commit()` Phase 2 has no rollback for already-renamed files (context.py:174-196). If rename 31 of 50 fails, files 1-30 have new content, 31-50 have old content. The user must `git checkout .` manually. The proposal says "full revert is always available via git" — true, but only if the user knows it failed. The current `commit()` return value (list of modified paths) is **never checked by any existing command** (scaffold, promote, migrate all ignore it). | User believes rename succeeded (command exits without clear error), doesn't revert, and the library is left in a partially-renamed state that neither `link-check` nor `ontos map` can diagnose as "half-renamed." |
+| `--scope library` default is correct | The `library` scope (`docs/ + .ontos-internal/ + scan_paths`) doesn't exist in the codebase. Current `scan_documents` implementations (maintain.py:232-243, map.py:709-714) use `docs_dir + scan_paths` only. The proposal recommends this scope but it must be built from scratch, and its behavior must be consistent with how `map` and `maintain` scan — otherwise `link-check` will report different results than `ontos map` validation. | User runs `link-check --scope library`, sees 48 broken links. Runs `ontos map`, sees 38 errors. Different numbers for the same library. User loses trust in both tools. |
+| Frontmatter comment destruction is acceptable | The proposal accepts comment stripping as a "known constraint" with mitigation via clean-git diffs. But `serialize_frontmatter()` doesn't do surgical field updates — it rewrites the ENTIRE frontmatter block. If `old_id` appears in 50 files' `depends_on`, all 50 get full frontmatter rewrites: field reordering, comment stripping, list format normalization (schema.py:295-387). The diff for a single ID rename becomes 50 files of noisy formatting changes obscuring the actual `depends_on` change. | Code review of rename diffs becomes impractical. The signal (one ID changed in `depends_on`) is buried in noise (field reordering, comment loss, list reformatting). Users skip review, defeating the purpose of clean-git safety. |
+| Bare-ID token matching with word boundaries won't produce false positives | Real library data proves otherwise. IDs like `v3_2_1` are prefixes of `v3_2_1_activation_resilience_proposal` — `\b` correctly excludes this because `_` is a word character. But IDs with dots (`v3.0.4`) create unexpected boundaries: `v3` matches inside `v3.0.4` because `.` is a non-word char. More critically: 14 broken `depends_on` references use mixed dot/underscore conventions for the same logical ID (`v3.0.3_Implementation_Spec` vs `v3_0_3_implementation_spec`). These near-miss patterns are exactly where false positives live. | Rename corrupts body text by replacing partial ID matches. Or rename misses references written in an alternate convention (dots vs underscores), leaving the library in a state where the "same" ID exists in two conventions and neither is correct. |
+
+---
+
+## Failure Mode Analysis
+
+| Failure | How It Happens | Would We Notice? | Severity |
+|---------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
+| `link-check` reports different results than `maintain` task 7 | `link-check` validates `depends_on` + `impacts` + `describes` + orphans with `--scope library`. Task 7 validates `depends_on` only via `build_graph()` with `docs + scan_paths` scope (maintain.py:549-578). Different field coverage AND different scan scope = different numbers. | Yes, but confusingly. User sees "48 broken links" from `link-check` and "38 broken links" from `maintain`. Both are "correct" for their scope/field coverage. The proposal says "make maintain task 7 call the same internal diagnostic" (proposal line 101) but doesn't mandate scope alignment. | **High** — erodes trust in tooling |
+| `rename` applied to an ID that appears as a substring of other IDs (separated by non-word chars) | User renames `v3_2` to `v4_0`. Body text contains "see v3_2.1 release notes" (using dots, a real pattern in this library). `\bv3_2\b` matches because `.` creates a word boundary after `v3_2`. The `1` after the dot is a separate token. Result: text becomes "see v4_0.1 release notes". | **No.** The dry-run would show this file as "1 body ref changed" but the user would have to manually inspect every match to catch it. With 50 files changing, this is impractical. | **Critical** — silent data corruption |
+| `rename` on a file with malformed frontmatter | Two parsing paths disagree: `core.frontmatter.parse_frontmatter()` returns `None` silently on malformed YAML (frontmatter.py:69-76). `io.yaml.parse_frontmatter_content()` raises `ValueError` (yaml.py:102-104). If rename uses the core parser and encounters malformed frontmatter, it silently skips the file. If it uses the IO parser, it aborts. The proposal doesn't specify which parser. Content Report says "Malformed Frontmatter: 0" — but that's current state. A user could create a malformed file between now and running rename. | Depends on parser choice. Silent skip = no notice. ValueError = noticed but unhelpful ("parse error on file X" with no guidance). | **Medium** — spec gap, not data loss |
+| `rename --apply` succeeds but `link-check` still shows broken references | `rename` updates frontmatter fields (`depends_on`, `impacts`, `describes`) and body references. But `link-check` may use a different scan scope, finding files that rename didn't scan. More fundamentally: `link-check` validates structured frontmatter references. It does NOT validate body-text references (no body-link parser in `link-check`). So rename touches body refs, but link-check can't verify they were updated correctly. | **Yes**, but misleading. `link-check` shows "clean" because frontmatter refs are updated, while body refs may be partially corrupted. False sense of security. | **High** — validation gap |
+| Body-link parser misidentifies a code fence boundary | Ontos_Manual.md has 24 `---` markers. Nested code fences require a state machine, not simple toggle. The proposal says "parse document into zones" but doesn't specify the algorithm. Python's standard library has no markdown AST parser. Rolling a custom zone parser for nested fences is error-prone. | Only if the renamed ID happens to appear in a code example. In this library: the Manual contains YAML examples with `depends_on: [parent_id]` — if `parent_id` is a real ID being renamed, the code example gets corrupted. | **High** — corrupts documentation examples |
+| User runs `rename` twice (idempotency) | User runs `rename old_id new_id --apply`. Succeeds. Runs same command again. Pre-validation step 1: "Verify `old_id` exists exactly once" — `old_id` no longer exists. Command fails with "`old_id` not found." This is correct behavior but the proposal doesn't specify it. | Yes, clear error. | **Low** — correct by accident |
+| `rename` on an ID that appears in the `concepts` field | Real example: `concepts: [v3.2.4, library-maintenance, graph-integrity]` (proposal's own frontmatter). `concepts` is excluded from rename scope. If a document ID matches a concept value, the concept won't be updated. Since `validate_concepts()` exists in suggestions.py:127-149 but is **never called** by ValidationOrchestrator (validation.py:72-86), `link-check` won't catch the stale concept either. | **No.** Neither `rename` nor `link-check` touches or validates `concepts`. | **Medium** — but concepts are tags, not references. Acceptable IF documented. Currently undocumented. |
+
+---
+
+## Edge Case Inventory
+
+| Edge Case | Real Evidence | Breaks What? |
+|-----------|--------------|--------------|
+| IDs containing dots (`v3.0.4`) | `v3.0.4_Code_Review_Claude` in `.ontos-internal/archive/` | Regex metachar: unescaped `.` matches any char. Word boundaries split at dots creating false prefix matches. |
+| IDs that are prefixes of other IDs | `v3_2_1` is prefix of 10+ IDs (`v3_2_1_activation_resilience_proposal`, `v3_2_1_code_review_codex`, etc.) | Word-boundary `\b` handles `_` correctly (word char), but body text using dots or hyphens as separators creates false matches. |
+| Documents with nested code fences | Ontos_Manual.md: 24 `---` markers, YAML code blocks inside markdown code fences | Zone parser must handle nested fences. Simple toggle state machine fails on nested fence patterns. |
+| 230 files without frontmatter | All 11 release files (`docs/releases/v3.*.md`), plus 219 others per Content Report | `rename` can't update `id`/`depends_on` fields that don't exist. Body text in these files may contain the renamed ID (release notes reference version IDs). Rename would either skip these silently or attempt body-only rewrite. |
+| Template file with YAML comments | `docs/_template.md` has inline comments: `id: _template  # Underscore prefix marks this as internal` | Excluded by skip_patterns in `.ontos.toml`. But: if a user copies the template and keeps comments, rename will strip them on touch. |
+| Circular renames (A to B then B to A) | No prevention mechanism specified | Second rename is valid (B exists, A doesn't). Result: all references flip twice, returning to original. Wasteful but not destructive. Low concern. |
+| `old_id` in document's own body text | Log documents reference their own ID in body text. | Rename correctly updates this — desirable behavior. Not actually an edge case. |
+| Files outside scan scope referencing renamed ID | `AGENTS.md` lists document IDs. `Ontos_Context_Map.md` renders document IDs. `CLAUDE.md` may reference doc paths. | These are auto-generated files. Proposal doesn't specify post-rename regeneration steps (`ontos map`, `ontos agents`). User must know to regenerate. |
+| `depends_on` containing same ID twice | No deduplication in `build_graph()` (graph.py:57-66 iterates the list as-is) | Rename would update both occurrences (correct). But the duplication itself is a data quality issue that neither command addresses. |
+| Mixed conventions for same logical ID | 14 broken refs use `v3.0.3_Implementation_Spec` (dots+CamelCase) vs `v3_0_3_implementation_spec` (underscores+lowercase) | `rename` operates on exact ID match. It won't find the alternate-convention references. These remain broken. `link-check` would report them, but the fix requires manual intervention, not rename. |
+
+---
+
+## Security & Integrity Surface
+
+| Vector | Applicable? | Risk Level | Notes |
+|--------|------------|------------|-------|
+| Path traversal in ID names | No | Negligible | IDs are dict keys and list values, never used as file paths in rename. File paths come from `scan_documents()` which uses `rglob` within specified directories. |
+| Shell injection via ID arguments | No | Negligible | CLI uses argparse; IDs are Python strings, never passed to `subprocess` or `os.system`. |
+| Symlink following during scan | **Yes** | **Medium** | `scan_documents()` uses `Path.rglob("*.md")` which follows symlinks by default (files.py:60-90). A symlink in `docs/` pointing outside the repo would cause rename to modify files outside the project. Mitigated by clean-git check (symlinked files outside repo wouldn't show in git status), but the write would still happen. |
+| Race condition between dry-run and apply | **Yes** | **Low** | Library could change between dry-run and `--apply` invocations. No lock held between runs. Mitigated by clean-git requirement: any intervening changes would dirty the working tree, and rename would refuse to run. Adequate mitigation. |
+
+---
+
+## Blind Spot Identification
+
+### 1. `link-check` and `rename` have no shared reference model
+
+This is the deepest architectural blind spot. The proposal designs two commands that operate on "references" but define them differently:
+
+- **`link-check`** finds references via `build_graph()` (depends_on only, per graph.py:57-66) + `validate_impacts()` (impacts, per validation.py:155-169) + `validate_describes()` (describes, per validation.py:171-178). All frontmatter-only. No body text.
+- **`rename`** rewrites references in frontmatter fields AND body text (via the new zone-aware parser).
+
+These are **two different reference ontologies**. After a rename:
+- `link-check` confirms: "all frontmatter references updated" (true)
+- `link-check` cannot confirm: "all body references updated" (not in its scope)
+- `link-check` cannot detect: "body references were incorrectly rewritten" (not in its scope)
+
+The proposal says `link-check` should serve as a "pre/post validation gate" for rename. It can't. It validates a subset of what rename modifies.
+
+### 2. Post-rename artifact regeneration
+
+`rename` modifies source files. But derived artifacts contain rendered references:
+- `Ontos_Context_Map.md` lists document IDs in tables and dependency trees
+- `AGENTS.md` references document IDs
+- Any cached `--json` output from previous `link-check` runs
+
+The proposal doesn't specify that users must regenerate these artifacts after rename. A user who runs `rename --apply` and then reads the context map sees stale IDs.
+
+### 3. Interaction with `ontos map` validation section
+
+`ontos map` already generates a validation section with broken links and warnings. After rename, `ontos map` would regenerate this section using `build_graph()` — the same function `link-check` uses. But `ontos map` and `link-check` may use different scopes (map uses `docs_dir + scan_paths`, link-check defaults to `library`). The validation numbers will differ.
+
+### 4. `describes` field semantics under rename
+
+The `describes` field points to a single document ID. If that document is renamed, `describes` needs updating. But `describes` validation uses WARNING severity (validation.py:171-178), not ERROR. So a stale `describes` reference after a failed/partial rename would appear as a warning, not an error. Users who filter on errors only would miss it.
+
+### 5. The `--scope` flag creates two truths
+
+With `--scope docs` and `--scope library` producing different results, users must understand which scope is appropriate. But the proposal recommends `library` as default for both commands. If `ontos map` continues to use `docs + scan_paths` scope, there are now three scope definitions in the system:
+- `map`/`maintain`: `docs_dir + scan_paths`
+- `link-check`/`rename` with `--scope docs`: `docs_dir + scan_paths`
+- `link-check`/`rename` with `--scope library`: `docs/ + .ontos-internal/ + scan_paths`
+
+No command explicitly documents which scope it uses, so users can't predict which files are covered.
+
+---
+
+## Risk Assessment Override
+
+### `ontos link-check`
+
+**Proposal rating:** Low risk.
+**My rating:** Low risk, **but with a trust hazard.**
+
+The command itself is read-only and safe. The risk is in divergent results. If `link-check --scope library` reports 48 broken links but `ontos map` reports 38 errors (because map doesn't scan `.ontos-internal/`), users will question which tool is authoritative. The proposal's recommendation to "make maintain task 7 call the same internal diagnostic function" (proposal line 101) partially addresses this, but scope alignment between `link-check`, `map`, and `maintain` is not mandated.
+
+**Missing mitigation:** The spec must mandate that `link-check --scope docs` produces results identical to `ontos map`'s validation section. If they ever disagree, users lose trust in both tools.
+
+### `ontos rename`
+
+**Proposal rating:** High risk with adequate mitigations.
+**My rating:** High risk with **partially adequate** mitigations.
+
+The mitigations (dry-run default, clean-git, in-memory planning, collision detection) address the **frontmatter rewrite** risk well. They do NOT adequately address the **body-link rewrite** risk, which is the novel and highest-risk component.
+
+**Missing mitigations:**
+
+1. **Exact matching semantics for bare IDs.** "Word-boundary-safe" is not a spec. The implementation needs: regex escaping of metacharacters in IDs, definition of what characters constitute ID boundaries (since IDs contain `_`, `-`, `.`), and explicit handling of IDs that are substrings of other IDs when separated by non-word characters.
+
+2. **Dry-run output must show exact match context.** Current proposal: "per-file change summary (frontmatter_fields_changed, body_refs_changed)." This is insufficient. The dry-run must show the exact line and surrounding context for each body-text match, so users can verify no false positives before `--apply`.
+
+3. **Post-rename validation.** The spec should require `rename --apply` to run `link-check` automatically after commit and report any remaining broken references. This catches references outside scan scope or in conventions rename didn't handle.
+
+---
+
+## Issues Found
+
+### Critical (Blocks Spec Development)
+
+**C1. Body-link bare-ID matching semantics are unspecified and will produce false positives on real library data.**
+
+The proposal says "strict token matches (word-boundary-safe, no substring rewrites)" but doesn't define matching rules for IDs containing regex metacharacters (dots) or non-word separator characters (hyphens). Real library evidence:
+
+- ID `v3.0.4_Code_Review_Claude` contains dots. Unescaped dot in regex matches any character.
+- A rename of any ID that is a prefix of another ID separated by a dot or hyphen (e.g., renaming `v3_2` when body text contains `v3_2.1`) will produce false-positive matches because `\b` treats `.` as a word boundary.
+- 14 broken references use mixed dot/underscore conventions for the same logical ID, proving that these patterns exist in practice.
+
+**Unblock requirement:** The spec must define exact tokenization rules for bare-ID matching, including: (a) regex escaping of metacharacters in IDs, (b) whether `_`, `-`, `.` are treated as word-internal or word-boundary characters for matching purposes, and (c) explicit handling of the "ID is a prefix separated by non-word char" case with test vectors drawn from real library IDs.
+
+**C2. `link-check` and `rename` operate on fundamentally different reference models, making post-rename validation incomplete.**
+
+`link-check` validates frontmatter references only (depends_on, impacts, describes). `rename` modifies frontmatter references AND body-text references. After rename, `link-check` cannot verify that body-text references were correctly updated, nor detect body-text references that were incorrectly rewritten (false positives). The proposal positions `link-check` as a validation gate for rename, but it can only validate half of what rename touches.
+
+**Unblock requirement:** Either (a) `link-check` must include body-reference detection (making it aware of the same reference model rename uses), or (b) `rename` must include its own post-apply validation pass that verifies body-text changes, or (c) the spec must explicitly disclaim body-text validation and document the gap for users.
+
+**C3. Dry-run output granularity is insufficient for body-text change review.**
+
+The proposal specifies dry-run output as "per-file change summary (frontmatter_fields_changed, body_refs_changed)" — aggregate counts per file. For frontmatter changes, this is adequate (the change is deterministic: old_id to new_id in a list). For body-text changes, counts are dangerous. A user seeing "3 body refs changed" in a 500-line manual cannot verify whether those 3 matches are correct without seeing exact line numbers and surrounding context. The clean-git mitigation (review via `git diff`) only works AFTER `--apply`, when the damage is done.
+
+**Unblock requirement:** Dry-run output for body-text matches must include: line number, matched text with surrounding context (at minimum 1 line before/after), and the zone classification (normal text vs code fence boundary decision). This is non-negotiable for a high-risk write command.
+
+### Major (Should Fix Before Spec)
+
+**M1. Two frontmatter parsing paths produce different results on edge cases, and rename doesn't specify which parser to use.**
+
+`core.frontmatter.parse_frontmatter()` returns `None` on malformed YAML (silent failure, frontmatter.py:69-76). `io.yaml.parse_frontmatter_content()` raises `ValueError` (loud failure, yaml.py:102-104). The fallback parser also handles colons differently: `partition(':')` splits on the first colon, truncating values containing colons (frontmatter.py:106). A file originally written by one parser path could corrupt when round-tripped through the other.
+
+**Fix:** Spec must mandate which parsing path `rename` uses and define behavior on parse failure (skip file with warning? abort entire rename?).
+
+**M2. Frontmatter serialization produces noisy diffs that defeat code review.**
+
+`serialize_frontmatter()` rewrites the entire frontmatter block with enforced field order (schema.py:315-319), normalized list formatting (schema.py:358-366), and stripped comments. A rename touching `depends_on` in 50 files produces 50 files of formatting noise plus the actual semantic change. Reviewing these diffs to verify correctness is impractical.
+
+**Fix:** Consider a targeted field-update strategy that modifies only the specific `depends_on`/`impacts`/`describes` line without round-tripping through the full serializer. Alternatively, accept the noise but document it prominently and count it as a risk factor.
+
+**M3. Files outside scan scope that reference the renamed ID are silently ignored.**
+
+`AGENTS.md`, `Ontos_Context_Map.md`, and potentially `CLAUDE.md` contain document IDs. These are auto-generated files outside the default scan scope. After rename, they contain stale references. The proposal doesn't specify post-rename regeneration steps.
+
+**Fix:** `rename --apply` output should include a warning: "Run `ontos map` and `ontos agents` to regenerate derived artifacts." Or better: run regeneration automatically.
+
+**M4. `--scope library` creates scope divergence with existing commands.**
+
+After v3.2.4, the system has three scope definitions: map/maintain (`docs_dir + scan_paths`), link-check/rename with `--scope docs` (same), and link-check/rename with `--scope library` (`docs/ + .ontos-internal/ + scan_paths`). `link-check --scope library` will report broken links in `.ontos-internal/` that `ontos map` doesn't show. Users will see conflicting numbers from different commands with no explanation.
+
+**Fix:** Either (a) align `map`'s scan scope with `--scope library` (breaking change), or (b) `link-check` must clearly label which scope produced its results, or (c) make `link-check --scope docs` the default to match existing command behavior, with `--scope library` as an explicit opt-in.
+
+### Minor (Consider)
+
+**m1. 40% orphan rate means exit code 1 is always triggered.**
+
+The proposal recommends orphans trigger exit code 1. With 237 orphans (40% of library), `link-check` will never return 0. CI gates that check exit code will always fail. Consider separate exit codes: 1 for broken references (actionable), 2 for orphans-only (informational).
+
+**m2. `validate_concepts()` exists but is never called.**
+
+`suggestions.py:127-149` has a `validate_concepts()` function. `ValidationOrchestrator.validate_all()` (validation.py:72-86) doesn't invoke it. This is an orphaned validation function. If `link-check` expands to validate concepts in the future, this function exists but may have bitrotted.
+
+**m3. Symlink following in `scan_documents()`.**
+
+`Path.rglob("*.md")` follows symlinks. A symlink in `docs/` pointing outside the repo would cause rename to modify external files. Clean-git check partially mitigates (external files aren't tracked), but the write still occurs. Consider adding `follow_symlinks=False` or documenting the behavior.
+
+---
+
+## Questions That Challenge the Architect's Decisions
+
+1. **The body-link parser is the highest-risk new component, but the proposal describes it in 4 bullet points (proposal lines 139-143). Given that this parser must handle 5 linking patterns (Design Report), nested code fences (Ontos_Manual.md has 24 `---` markers), and IDs with regex metacharacters (real library data), why is the spec for this component less detailed than the spec for collision detection, which is a solved problem?**
+
+2. **The proposal says `link-check` should serve as a pre/post validation gate for rename. But `link-check` only validates frontmatter references, while rename also modifies body-text references. How will a user verify that body-text renames were correct? Are you relying on the user to manually review `git diff` output across potentially 50+ files, including formatting noise from the serializer?**
+
+3. **The feasibility report recommended deferring `rename` until "reference indexing/rewrite engine + dry-run/report + collision policy are designed." The design report estimated 200-300 lines of new code. But the body-link parser alone — handling zone detection, nested fences, inline code spans, regex escaping, word-boundary semantics, and markdown link target resolution — is a 200+ line component by itself. Is the total implementation effort underestimated, and does that change the risk calculus?**
+
+---
+
+## Verdict
+
+**Request Changes**
+
+### Unblock requirements:
+
+1. **Define exact bare-ID matching semantics** with test vectors drawn from real library IDs (including IDs with dots, IDs that are prefixes of other IDs, and the mixed dot/underscore convention patterns found in 14 broken references). The spec must answer: given ID `v3_2` and body text `v3_2.1`, does the body-link parser match? Why or why not?
+
+2. **Resolve the `link-check` / `rename` reference model gap.** Either expand `link-check` to detect body references, add post-apply verification to `rename`, or explicitly document the gap with user-facing warnings.
+
+3. **Specify dry-run output for body-text matches at line-level granularity** (not file-level counts). This is the user's only opportunity to catch false positives before `--apply`.
+
+These three items are the minimum changes needed before the spec phase can begin. The proposal's treatment of frontmatter rename is sound. The treatment of body-text rename is underspecified to the point where implementation would require design decisions that should be made at the proposal level, not the code level.

+# v3.2.4 Pre-Approval Alignment Review
+
+> **Reviewer:** Antigravity, powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro
+> **Review Date:** 2026-02-11
+> **Proposal Under Review:** [v3.2.4_Proposal_Library_Maintenance.md](file:///Users/jonathanoh/Dev/Ontos-dev/.ontos-internal/strategy/proposals/v3.2.4/v3.2.4_Proposal_Library_Maintenance.md)
+> **Baseline Documents:** Feasibility Report, Design Report, Content Report
+
+---
+
+## Review Verdict: ✅ APPROVE WITH OBSERVATIONS
+
+The proposal is **architecturally sound** and demonstrates strong alignment with existing codebase patterns, discovery evidence, and prior decisions. No blocking deviations were found. The observations below document areas where the proposal introduces **new patterns** that need explicit tracking, and where minor specification gaps should be addressed during implementation.
+
+---
+
+## 1. Architecture Compliance
+
+### 1.1 CLI Registration Pattern — ✅ Aligned
+
+The proposal specifies two new commands (`link-check`, `rename`) as standalone CLI entries. This follows the established pattern:
+
+```
+create_parser() → _register_* → _cmd_* handler → *Options dataclass → *_command()
+```
+
+**Evidence:** All 21 existing commands follow this exact pattern (`cli.py:31-89`, `cli.py:523-950`). The proposal's command surface design is consistent.
+
+**No deviation.**
+
+### 1.2 Command Taxonomy Placement — ✅ Aligned
+
+| Command | Proposed Group | Assessment |
+|---------|---------------|------------|
+| `link-check` | Diagnose | Correct. Joins `doctor` and `query` as read-only inspectors. |
+| `rename` | Maintain | Correct. Joins `maintain`, `consolidate`, `promote` as library upkeep tools. |
+
+The Design Report raised a concern about `link-check` fragmenting the mental model with `doctor` and `maintain` task 7. The proposal addresses this explicitly (§2, "Relationship to `maintain` task 7 and `doctor`") by defining clear role separation and recommending that `maintain` task 7 call the same internal diagnostic function. **This is the correct mitigation.**
+
+### 1.3 JSON Output Convention — ✅ Aligned
+
+The proposal specifies `--json` for both commands. The codebase uses `emit_json()` / `JsonOutputHandler` from `ontos.ui.json_output` with a `{"status": ..., "data": ...}` envelope pattern. The proposal's JSON output shapes (`summary`, `broken_links`, `orphans` for link-check; change plan for rename) are compatible with this envelope.
+
+**Observation O1:** The proposal defines a specific JSON shape for `link-check` (§2) but does not specify the JSON shape for `rename` dry-run output beyond "full change plan." The implementation should follow the `JsonOutputHandler.result()` pattern with a `data` wrapper.
+
+### 1.4 SessionContext / Two-Phase Commit — ✅ Aligned
+
+The proposal correctly identifies `SessionContext` for `rename`'s write operations and explicitly acknowledges the Phase 2 partial-commit limitation (§3, "Known limitation"). 
+
+**Verified against source:** `SessionContext.commit()` (`context.py:132-202`) confirms that if Phase 2 fails at file N, files 1 through N-1 are already committed. The proposal's mitigation (clean-git requirement + fail-fast pre-validation) is the same strategy recommended by the Design Report (§2.4) and is architecturally sound.
+
+### 1.5 Dry-Run / `--apply` Precedent — ✅ Aligned
+
+The proposal specifies dry-run-by-default with `--apply` for `rename`, directly following the `scaffold` precedent.
+
+**Verified:** `ScaffoldOptions` (`scaffold.py:24-31`) defaults `apply=False, dry_run=True`. The proposal mirrors this exactly.
+
+---
+
+## 2. Constraint Verification
+
+### 2.1 Two Parsing Paths — ✅ Addressed
+
+The proposal acknowledges the dual-parser constraint (§6: "Two parsing paths exist; command behavior must be consistent across both"). The existing `_load_docs_for_graph` in `maintain.py:245-259` already uses `parse_frontmatter_content` from the IO layer with `read_file_lenient` from obsidian. Both new commands should follow this same pattern.
+
+**No deviation.** The proposal correctly flags this as a constraint without proposing to change parser internals.
+
+### 2.2 Duplicate ID Silent Overwrite — ✅ Addressed
+
+The proposal explicitly calls out that current loaders silently overwrite duplicate IDs (§6: "Duplicate IDs currently can be overwritten silently in some loaders") and requires both `rename` and `link-check` to "detect and fail explicitly."
+
+**Verified:** `maintain.py:255` (`docs[doc.id] = doc`) confirms silent overwrite. The proposal's requirement for explicit detection is a **net improvement** over current behavior, not a violation.
+
+### 2.3 No External HTTP Dependencies — ✅ Aligned
+
+The proposal explicitly excludes external URL checking (§1: "Out-of-scope"). This preserves the current zero-HTTP-dependency posture confirmed in `pyproject.toml`.
+
+### 2.4 Frontmatter Comment Destruction — ✅ Addressed
+
+The proposal acknowledges this constraint (§4: "Frontmatter comment destruction risk") and accepts it as a known limitation with mitigations:
+- Only rewrite files with real reference changes
+- Clean-git requirement for safe recovery
+- Explicit warning in command output
+
+**Verified:** `serialize_frontmatter()` in `schema.py:295-333` uses a hardcoded `field_order` and strips comments. This behavior is pre-existing and affects all write commands (`scaffold`, `promote`, `stub`, `migrate`). The proposal does not worsen this.
+
+---
+
+## 3. Backward Compatibility
+
+### 3.1 Explicit Commitments — ✅ All Upheld
+
+| Commitment (§6) | Status |
+|-----------------|--------|
+| No automatic source conversion to Obsidian wikilinks | ✅ Respected |
+| No standalone mass standardization rewrite | ✅ Respected |
+| No schema expansion for `summary` field | ✅ Respected |
+| No file/directory move semantics in `rename` | ✅ Respected |
+| `link-check` remains read-only | ✅ Respected |
+
+These commitments are **directly aligned** with all three discovery reports' recommendations.
+
+### 3.2 No Breaking Changes to Existing Commands — ✅ Verified
+
+The proposal does not modify any existing command's interface, output format, or exit code behavior. Both `link-check` and `rename` are additive.
+
+---
+
+## 4. Consistency with Prior Decisions
+
+### 4.1 v3.1 Obsidian Deferral — ✅ Respected
+
+v3.1 explicitly deferred source-side Obsidian retrofit. The proposal maintains this deferral: wikilink conversion and source migration are explicitly out of scope (§1).
+
+### 4.2 Discovery Report Recommendations — ✅ Followed
+
+| Discovery Recommendation | Proposal Response |
+|--------------------------|-------------------|
+| Ship `link-check` as P0 (all three reports) | ✅ Included |
+| Ship `rename` as genuine new capability (Design + Content) | ✅ Included |
+| Defer `retrofit --obsidian` (all three reports) | ✅ Explicitly deferred |
+| Defer `retrofit --lint-fix` / summary fill (Design + Content) | ✅ Explicitly deferred |
+| Require clean-git for destructive ops (Design §1.3) | ✅ Adopted |
+| Default dry-run for write ops (Design §1.3) | ✅ Adopted |
+| Unify scan scope (Feasibility §3.4) | ✅ Adopted via `--scope` flag |
+
+### 4.3 Backlog Alignment — ✅ No Conflicts
+
+The proposal does not pre-empt planned backlog items (`doctor --repair`, file moves in v3.3). The `link-check` / `maintain` task 7 relationship is explicitly managed to avoid fragmentation.
+
+---
+
+## 5. Observations (Non-Blocking)
+
+### O1. `--scope` is a New Pattern
+
+No existing CLI command has a `--scope` flag. The proposal introduces `--scope docs|library` for both commands. This is **architecturally reasonable** given the inconsistent scan behaviors documented in the feasibility report, but it is a new UX pattern that establishes precedent.
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> Consider whether future commands (`query`, etc.) should retroactively adopt `--scope` for consistency, or whether this remains specific to maintenance commands. This is a **design decision to track**, not a blocker.
+
+### O2. `rename` JSON Output Shape Underspecified
+
+The proposal specifies detailed JSON output for `link-check` (§2) but only says rename should emit "a full change plan" with `--json` (§3). During implementation, define the explicit JSON shape (e.g., `{files: [{path, changes: [{field, old, new}]}], summary: {total_files, ...}}`).
+
+### O3. Exit Code Semantics for `rename`
+
+The proposal defines exit codes for `link-check` (§2: 0 = clean, 1 = issues found) but does not specify exit codes for `rename`. Suggested semantics:
+- `0`: rename applied or dry-run valid
+- `1`: pre-validation failure or execution error
+
+### O4. `describes` Validation Gap in Suggestions
+
+The proposal specifies that `link-check` should include `describes` broken references with confidence-scored fix suggestions (§2). However, `validate_describes()` (`validation.py:171-178`) does not currently call the suggestion engine — it only emits bare warnings without candidates. The `link-check` implementation will need to add suggestion generation for `describes` references, which is a small extension of the existing `suggest_candidates_for_broken_ref` pattern.
+
+### O5. Open Question Recommendations Are Sound
+
+All four open questions (§5) have reasonable recommendations:
+- **Q1 (orphans trigger exit 1):** Consistent with CI gate semantics
+- **Q2 (include all three fields):** Supported by content report evidence  
+- **Q3 (rewrite only semantic ID refs):** Correctly conservative
+- **Q4 (shared library scanner):** Addresses a real systemic risk
+
+---
+
+## 6. Summary Matrix
+
+| Review Dimension | Verdict | Notes |
+|-----------------|---------|-------|
+| Architecture Compliance | ✅ Pass | All patterns matched |
+| Constraint Verification | ✅ Pass | All constraints respected |
+| Backward Compatibility | ✅ Pass | No breaking changes |
+| Prior Decision Consistency | ✅ Pass | Discovery recommendations followed |
+| Specification Completeness | ⚠️ Minor gaps | O2 (rename JSON shape), O3 (rename exit codes) |
+| New Pattern Introduction | ⚠️ Track | O1 (`--scope` flag precedent) |
+
+---
+
+**Recommendation:** Approve the proposal. Address observations O2 and O3 during implementation specification, and track O1 as a design precedent decision for future commands.

+## Blocking Issues
+
+Combined list of issues that block moving to Phase A spec development.
+
+| # | Issue | Flagged By | Category | Action Required |
+|---|-------|------------|----------|-----------------|
+| B1 | **Body-link bare-ID matching semantics are unspecified.** IDs contain regex metacharacters (dots in `v3.0.4_Code_Review_Claude`), and `\b` word boundaries interact unpredictably with dots/hyphens. A rename of `v3_2` when body text contains `v3_2.1` would false-positive match because `.` creates a word boundary. 14 broken references in the library already use mixed dot/underscore conventions, proving these patterns exist in practice. | Claude (Critical) | Safety / Correctness | Define exact tokenization rules for bare-ID matching: (a) regex escaping of metacharacters, (b) whether `_`, `-`, `.` are word-internal or word-boundary for matching, (c) explicit handling of "ID is a prefix separated by non-word char" case with test vectors from real library IDs. |
+| B2 | **`link-check` and `rename` operate on different reference models.** `link-check` validates frontmatter only (`depends_on`, `impacts`, `describes`). `rename` modifies frontmatter AND body-text references. After rename, `link-check` cannot verify body-text changes were correct, nor detect false-positive rewrites. The proposal positions `link-check` as a validation gate for `rename`, but it can only validate half of what `rename` touches. | Claude (Critical) | Architecture / Validation Gap | Either: (a) expand `link-check` to detect body references, (b) add post-apply verification to `rename`, or (c) explicitly document the gap with user-facing warnings. |
+| B3 | **Dry-run output for body-text matches is file-level counts, not line-level context.** "3 body refs changed" in a 500-line manual gives users no way to verify correctness before `--apply`. The clean-git mitigation (`git diff`) only works AFTER apply, when damage is done. | Claude (Critical) | UX / Safety | Dry-run must include: line number, matched text with surrounding context (min 1 line before/after), and zone classification for each body-text match. |
+| B4 | **Divergent default scope creates UX split with existing commands.** Proposal defaults to `library` scope, but `map`, `maintain`, `query` default to `docs`. A user running `rename` might modify files that `map` doesn't see. `link-check --scope library` would report 48 broken links while `map` shows 38 — different numbers for the same library with no explanation. | Gemini (Critical), Claude (Major — M4) | UX / Consistency | Either unify system-wide scan scope first, or make `docs` the default with prominent warning if issues exist outside that scope. |
+| B5 | **Silent ID collision in scan phase.** Existing loaders (`docs[doc.id] = doc`) silently overwrite duplicate IDs. Both `link-check` and `rename` would operate on a partial graph if duplicates exist. | Gemini (Critical) | Correctness | Mandate explicit collision-check in scanning phase. `link-check` must report duplicates as P0 errors. `rename` must abort if duplicates exist in scope. |
+
+---
+
+## Should-Fix Issues
+
+Non-blocking but recommended before or during spec development.
+
+| # | Issue | Flagged By | Category | Recommendation |
+|---|-------|------------|----------|----------------|
+| S1 | **Exit code over-sensitivity.** 40% of library (237 docs) are orphans. Orphans triggering exit `1` means `link-check` will never return `0` in CI. | Gemini (Major), Claude (Minor — m1) | UX / CI Integration | Distinguish hard failures (broken refs → exit 1) from soft warnings (orphans → exit 0 or separate code 2). |
+| S2 | **Zone-aware body parser strategy unspecified.** The highest-risk new component is described in 4 bullet points. Does not specify regex vs. AST approach, handling of nested fences, or indented code blocks. Ontos_Manual.md has 24 `---` markers and YAML code blocks inside markdown code fences. | Gemini (Major), Claude (Failure Mode) | Implementation Risk | Specify parsing strategy explicitly. Define boundary handling (nested fences, indented code blocks). |
+| S3 | **Template/comment destruction risk via `serialize_frontmatter()`.** Rename touching `depends_on` in 50 files produces 50 files of formatting noise (field reordering, comment stripping, list reformatting) obscuring the actual semantic change. Code review becomes impractical. | Gemini (Major), Claude (Major — M2) | UX / Code Review | Either implement targeted field-update (modify only the specific line), exclude `templates/` from write-loop, or document the noise prominently as a risk factor. |
+| S4 | **Two frontmatter parsing paths produce different results on edge cases.** `core.frontmatter.parse_frontmatter()` returns `None` silently on malformed YAML. `io.yaml.parse_frontmatter_content()` raises `ValueError`. Proposal doesn't specify which parser `rename` uses. | Claude (Major — M1), Antigravity (§2.1 — noted as constraint) | Spec Gap | Spec must mandate which parsing path `rename` uses and define behavior on parse failure (skip with warning? abort entire rename?). |
+| S5 | **Post-rename artifact regeneration not specified.** `AGENTS.md`, `Ontos_Context_Map.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` contain document IDs that become stale after rename. Proposal doesn't specify regeneration steps. | Claude (Major — M3) | Completeness | `rename --apply` output should warn: "Run `ontos map` and `ontos agents` to regenerate." Or run regeneration automatically. |
+| S6 | **`rename` JSON output shape underspecified.** Proposal defines detailed JSON for `link-check` but only says rename emits "a full change plan." | Antigravity (O1, O2) | Spec Completeness | Define explicit JSON shape during spec (e.g., `{files: [{path, changes}], summary: {...}}`). Follow `JsonOutputHandler.result()` pattern. |
+| S7 | **`rename` exit codes not specified.** Proposal defines exit codes for `link-check` (0 = clean, 1 = issues) but not for `rename`. | Antigravity (O3) | Spec Completeness | Suggested: 0 = applied/dry-run valid, 1 = pre-validation failure or execution error. |
+
+---
+
+## Minor Issues
+
+Consider but not required.
+
+| # | Issue | Flagged By | Recommendation |
+|---|-------|------------|----------------|
+| M1 | Missing "census" coverage stat in `link-check` output (e.g., "593 files found, 363 tracked"). | Gemini | Low-effort addition. Content Report's "39% untagged" ice berg supports this. |
+| M2 | Future `link-check --fix --min-confidence 0.9` path. Internal API should support confidence-based auto-fix. | Gemini | Ensure API design doesn't preclude this extension. |
+| M3 | `validate_concepts()` exists (`suggestions.py:127-149`) but is never called by `ValidationOrchestrator`. Orphaned validation function. | Claude (m2) | Document or integrate before it bitrots. |
+| M4 | Symlink following in `scan_documents()` — `Path.rglob("*.md")` follows symlinks by default. Rename could modify files outside the repo. | Claude (m3) | Consider `follow_symlinks=False` or document the behavior. |
+| M5 | `describes` validation doesn't call suggestion engine — only emits bare warnings without candidates. `link-check` will need to extend this. | Antigravity (O4) | Small extension of `suggest_candidates_for_broken_ref` pattern. |
+| M6 | `concepts` field excluded from `rename` scope. If a doc ID matches a concept value, the concept won't be updated, and `link-check` won't catch it. | Claude (Failure Mode) | Acceptable IF documented. Concepts are tags, not references. Currently undocumented. |
+| M7 | `--scope` is a new CLI pattern — no existing command has this flag. Establishes a precedent. | Antigravity (O1) | Track as a design precedent decision. Consider whether future commands adopt it. |
+
+---
+
+## Agreement Analysis
+
+### Strong Agreement (2+ reviewers flagged the same concern)
+
+| Concern | Flagged By | Severity |
+|---------|------------|----------|
+| **Default scope divergence** with existing commands (`library` vs `docs`) | Gemini (Critical), Claude (Major), Antigravity (Observation) | **Blocking** — all three reviewers raised scope consistency concerns. Highest-confidence finding. |
+| **Duplicate ID silent overwrite** in scan phase | Gemini (Critical), Antigravity (§2.2 — verified), Claude (Assumption Attack) | **Blocking** — Gemini and Claude flag as critical risk. Antigravity confirms the code behavior (`maintain.py:255`). |
+| **Frontmatter serialization noise** defeating code review of rename diffs | Gemini (Major), Claude (Major — M2) | **Should-Fix** — both agree the current serializer makes 50-file rename diffs impractical to review. |
+| **Exit code sensitivity** with 40% orphan rate | Gemini (Major), Claude (Minor) | **Should-Fix** — Gemini rates Major, Claude rates Minor. Both agree exit 1 for orphans is problematic at current scale. |
+| **Zone-aware body parser** needs more specification | Gemini (Major), Claude (Critical + Failure Mode) | **Blocking/Should-Fix** — overlaps with B1. Claude's concern is broader (exact matching semantics); Gemini's is about implementation strategy. |
+| **`SessionContext` Phase 2 partial-commit limitation** | Gemini (verified w/ warning), Antigravity (§1.4 — verified), Claude (Assumption Attack) | **Acknowledged by all** — the proposal's mitigation (clean-git + fail-fast) is accepted as adequate by Gemini and Antigravity. Claude notes users may not realize a failure occurred. |
+
+### Disagreements
+
+| Topic | Reviewer A View | Reviewer B View | Type | Recommendation |
+|-------|----------------|-----------------|------|----------------|
+| **Overall verdict** | Antigravity: Approve with Observations (0 blockers) | Gemini: Request Changes (2 blockers); Claude: Request Changes (3 blockers) | Priority | Antigravity's review focused on architecture compliance and backward compatibility (all pass). Gemini and Claude focused on execution safety and UX — finding gaps the alignment lens doesn't cover. **CA should treat as "Needs Revision."** |
+| **Duplicate ID handling** | Antigravity: "net improvement over current behavior, not a violation" | Gemini: "Critical — must mandate collision-check" | Priority | Both agree the proposal correctly identifies the issue. Disagreement is whether the proposal's current language is sufficient (Antigravity) or needs stronger mandating (Gemini). **CA should strengthen the mandate.** |
+| **Exit code for orphans** | Gemini: Major — exit 1 will always fail in CI | Claude: Minor — "consider separate exit codes" | Priority | Same concern, different severity. **CA decides.** |
+| **`SessionContext` adequacy** | Antigravity: "architecturally sound mitigation" | Claude: "`commit()` return value is never checked by any existing command — user may not know failure occurred" | Factual + Priority | Claude's observation that the return value is unchecked is a factual finding (code-verified). Antigravity's finding that the mitigation strategy is architecturally precedented is also correct. **CA should ensure rename checks commit return value and reports clearly on partial failure.** |

+|---------|----------|---------------|
+| **`link-check` and `rename` have no shared reference model** — two commands operating on "references" define them differently (frontmatter-only vs. frontmatter + body). Post-rename validation gap. | Claude (C2) | This is the deepest architectural insight. If `link-check` can't validate what `rename` modified, the safety model has a hole that users can't see. |
+| **Dry-run must show line-level context for body-text matches**, not just file-level counts. | Claude (C3) | Without this, the dry-run safety model is theater for body-text changes. Users can't verify correctness of the highest-risk operation. |
+| **230 files without frontmatter** — rename can't update structured fields that don't exist. Body text in these files (e.g., release notes) may contain the renamed ID. | Claude (Edge Case) | Rename may silently skip these files or attempt body-only rewrite. Behavior is unspecified. |
+| **Post-rename derived artifact staleness** — `AGENTS.md`, `Ontos_Context_Map.md` become stale. | Claude (Blind Spot #2) | Users who trust these files after rename get stale information. No warning in proposal. |
+| **`describes` field uses WARNING severity, not ERROR** — stale `describes` after partial rename appears as warning only. | Claude (Blind Spot #4) | Users filtering on errors miss this. |
+| **Idempotency of rename is correct by accident** — second run fails with "old_id not found" (correct behavior, but unspecified). | Claude (Failure Mode) | Not an issue, but should be documented for completeness. |
+| **`--scope` flag is a new UX pattern** with no precedent in existing commands. | Antigravity (O1) | Establishes a pattern. Decision to track: should future commands adopt it? |
+| **`describes` validation doesn't call suggestion engine** — no confidence-scored candidates for `describes` broken refs. | Antigravity (O4) | `link-check` implementation will need a small extension here. |
+| **Census/coverage stats** as low-effort addition to `link-check` output. | Gemini (Minor) | High-value UX addition. "593 files found, 363 tracked" surfaces the untagged iceberg. |

+## Required Actions for CA
+
+Prioritized list of what the CA must address before moving to Phase A.
+
+| Priority | Action | Addresses | Effort Estimate |
+|----------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
+| 1 | **Define exact bare-ID tokenization and matching rules** with test vectors from real library IDs (IDs with dots, prefix IDs, mixed conventions). Answer: given `v3_2` and body text `v3_2.1`, does the parser match? | B1 | Medium — design decision + test vectors |
+| 2 | **Resolve the `link-check` / `rename` reference model gap.** Choose: expand link-check, add post-apply verification to rename, or explicitly disclaim + document. | B2 | Low–Medium — design decision |
+| 3 | **Specify dry-run output for body-text matches at line-level granularity** (line number, context, zone classification). | B3 | Low — output format specification |
+| 4 | **Resolve default scope divergence.** Choose: unify system-wide scope, or default to `docs` with opt-in `library`, or label scope prominently in all output. | B4 | Low — design decision |
+| 5 | **Strengthen duplicate ID collision-check mandate** — make it explicit that both commands detect and fail on duplicates in scanning phase. | B5 | Low — language strengthening |
+| 6 | **Decide exit code semantics for orphans** — separate from broken references or combined? | S1 | Low — design decision |
+| 7 | **Specify body-link parser strategy** — regex vs. AST, nested fences, indented code blocks. | S2 | Medium — design decision |
+| 8 | **Address serialization noise** — targeted field update, template exclusion, or documented acceptance. | S3 | Medium — design or implementation decision |
+| 9 | **Mandate parsing path for `rename`** and define parse-failure behavior. | S4 | Low — specification |
+| 10 | **Specify post-rename regeneration** for derived artifacts. | S5 | Low — add warning or auto-regeneration |
+
+---
+
+## Decision Summary
+
+**Status:** Needs CA Response First
+
+The CA must resolve the following before the proposal can move to Phase A specification:
+
+1. **B1 — Bare-ID matching semantics:** Define tokenization rules with real library test vectors. This is the most critical unresolved design question — it determines whether `rename` is safe for body-text operations.
+
+2. **B2 — Reference model gap:** Decide how body-text changes are validated post-rename. This is an architectural decision that shapes both commands.
+
+3. **B3 — Dry-run granularity:** Specify line-level output for body-text matches. This is straightforward but non-negotiable for safety.
+
+4. **B4 — Scope default:** Resolve the divergence with existing commands. Three reviewers flagged this independently — highest-confidence finding.
+
+5. **B5 — Duplicate ID mandate:** Strengthen the language. Both reviewers who flagged this agree on the fix; the proposal already identifies the problem but needs stronger specification.
+
+**Verification needed:** Items B1 and B2 require design decisions that should be reviewed (brief CA response is sufficient). Items B3–B5 are straightforward specification additions that can be verified during spec review.

+# v3.2.4 Pre-Phase A: Peer Review — Library Maintenance Commands
+
+**Reviewer:** Gemini (Peer Reviewer)
+**Author:** Codex (Chief Architect)
+**Status:** Request Changes
+**Date:** 2026-02-10
+
+---
+
+## 1. Executive Summary
+
+The v3.2.4 proposal is a well-grounded response to the discovery reports, particularly in its decision to defer the high-risk/low-value `retrofit` variants in favor of `link-check` and `rename`. The data in the **Content Report** (48 broken links, 40% orphans) makes the case for these commands undeniable.
+
+However, there are significant gaps in the **execution model** (scope consistency) and **safety logic** (duplicate IDs) that would lead to a flawed specification if not addressed.
+
+---
+
+## 2. Issues Found
+
+### Critical (Blocks Spec Development)
+
+1.  **Divergent Default Scope:** The proposal recommends `library` as the default scope for `link-check` and `rename`. While logically sound (given that .ontos-internal contains 90% of the strategy docs), this creates a **UX split** with every other command (`map`, `maintain`, `query`) which defaults to `docs`. A user running `ontos rename` might inadvertently modify files that `ontos map` doesn't even see. 
+    *   **Requirement:** Either unify the system-wide scan scope first, or make `docs` the default with a very prominent "Discovery" warning if orphans/broken links exist outside that scope.
+2.  **Silent ID Collision in Scan Phase:** The **Feasibility Report** notes that existing loaders (`docs[doc.id] = doc`) silently overwrite duplicate IDs. If `rename` or `link-check` runs on a library with duplicate IDs, they will operate on a "partial" graph, potentially missing references or renaming the wrong document.
+    *   **Requirement:** The spec must mandate an explicit `collision-check` in the scanning phase for both commands. `link-check` must report duplicate IDs as P0 errors. `rename` must abort if any duplicates exist in the requested scope.
+
+### Major (Should Fix Before Spec)
+
+1.  **Exit Code Over-Sensitivity:** The proposal sets exit `1` if *any* orphan is found. The **Content Report** shows that 40% of the library (237 docs) are orphans. This ensures `link-check` will fail in CI for almost any real-world project.
+    *   **Requirement:** Distinguish between **Hard Failures** (broken `depends_on`, `impacts`, `describes`) and **Soft Warnings** (orphans, staleness). Exit code `1` should be reserved for broken references.
+2.  **Zone-Aware Parser Ambiguity:** The "zone-aware" body parser is the highest-risk new code. The proposal does not specify if this is a regex-based approximation or a formal Markdown AST (e.g., `mistune`).
+    *   **Requirement:** Specify the parsing strategy. A regex approach is likely sufficient for "code block detection" but the spec must define the boundaries (e.g., does it handle nested fences? indented code blocks?).
+3.  **Template Destruction Risk:** The **Design Report** confirms that `serialize_frontmatter()` strips YAML comments. `rename` will touch any file referencing the renamed ID. If the `_template.md` or a manual with commented YAML is touched, the comments are lost.
+    *   **Requirement:** The spec should explicitly exclude `.ontos-internal/templates` from the `rename` write-loop or implement a "comment-safe" serializer.
+
+### Minor (Consider)
+
+1.  **Missing "Census" Data:** The **Content Report** suggests a `census` command to track the "39% untagged" iceberg. Adding a "Coverage" stat to the `link-check` summary (e.g., "593 files found, 363 tracked") would be a low-effort, high-value addition.
+2.  **Confidence-Based Fixes:** Since `link-check` already calculates confidence scores for suggestions, a future `ontos link-check --fix --min-confidence 0.9` would be a natural evolution. The spec should ensure the internal API supports this.
+
+---
+
+## 3. Reference Verification
+
+| Proposal Claim | Reference Verification | Result |
+|----------------|------------------------|--------|
+| `link-check` is ~90% built. | **Design Report** confirms Task 7 in `maintain` is the core logic. | **Verified** |
+| Broken links are a high-volume problem. | **Content Report** identifies 48 broken `depends_on` and 13 broken `impacts`. | **Verified** |
+| `rename` addresses stale reference patterns. | **Content Report** shows specific examples (`v2_9_implementation_plan`). | **Verified** |
+| `SessionContext` handles atomicity. | **Feasibility Report** confirms Phase 1/2 logic but warns on Phase 2 failures. | **Verified w/ Warning** |
+
+---
+
+## 4. Positive Observations
+
+- **Evidence-Led Descoping:** Excellent job deferring `retrofit --lint-fix`. The **Content Report** proved that "excessive concepts" and `summary` fields were ghosts.
+- **Safety Precedents:** Adopting the `scaffold` precedent (dry-run by default, `--apply` to commit) and the "clean git" requirement is the correct way to handle cross-library writes.
+- **JSON Support:** Including `--json` in the initial proposal ensures this utility can be used in specialized CI workflows from day one.
+
+---
+
+## 5. Verdict
+
+**Request Changes**
+
+The proposal is 90% of the way there. Once the **scope consistency**, **collision detection**, and **exit code sensitivity** are refined, it will be ready for specification.

+# v3.2.4 Proposal: Library Maintenance Commands
+
+## 1. Overview
+
+v3.2.4 delivers two focused maintenance commands:
+
+1. `ontos link-check` (read-only graph diagnostics)
+2. `ontos rename <old_id> <new_id>` (atomic ID rename with global reference updates)
+
+This scope is driven by discovery evidence, not greenfield feature ideation:
+
+- The library currently has high integrity drift: **48 broken `depends_on` links (16%)**, **13 broken `impacts` links (11%)**, and **237 orphans (40%)** (Content report).
+- `link-check` already exists in near-complete form inside `maintain` task 7 and can be promoted to first-class CLI with low risk (Feasibility + Design reports).
+- `rename` is the only truly missing operational capability and directly addresses the observed "renamed doc, stale references" failure pattern (all three reports).
+
+Out-of-scope items stay deferred for v3.2.4: Obsidian source migration, standalone standardization rewrites, lint-fix summary/concept automation, file moves, external URL checking, and `doctor --repair`.
+
+Approach:
+
+- Reuse existing graph, validation, suggestion, and transaction infrastructure wherever possible.
+- Add only two new command surfaces and one new markdown-aware body reference parser.
+- Keep destructive behavior opt-in (`--apply`), with clean-git and pre-validation gates.
+
+## 2. `ontos link-check` Design
+
+### Command interface
+
+```bash
+ontos link-check [--json] [--scope docs|library]
+```
+
+- `--json`: machine-readable output.
+- `--scope`: controls scan domain.
+  - `docs`: current `maintain`-like scope (`docs_dir + scan_paths`).
+  - `library` (recommended default): `docs/ + .ontos-internal/ + scan_paths`.
+
+### What is reused
+
+- Document scanning/loading pipeline: `scan_documents`-based walkers (Feasibility report).
+- Graph integrity checks:
+  - `build_graph()` for broken `depends_on`
+  - `detect_orphans()`
+  - existing cycle/depth support remains available (Feasibility + Design reports).
+- Cross-reference validation for `impacts` and `describes` from validation layer (Feasibility report).
+- Suggestion engine with confidence scores from `suggestions.py` (Design report).
+- Existing maintain task logic as extraction target (`check_links` in task 7) (Feasibility + Design reports).
+
+### New code required
+
+- New `link-check` command module + CLI registration.
+- Shared diagnostic collector that unifies:
+  - broken `depends_on`
+  - broken `impacts`
+  - broken `describes`
+  - orphan IDs
+  - confidence-scored fix suggestions
+- Output renderers:
+  - full human-readable report (no hard cap)
+  - JSON serializer
+- Exit-code mapping.
+
+### Output format
+
+Human-readable output sections:
+
+1. Summary counts
+2. Broken references by field (`depends_on`, `impacts`, `describes`)
+3. Suggested replacements with confidence
+4. Orphan list
+
+JSON output shape:
+
+- `summary` (counts)
+- `broken_links` (array of `{source_id, field, missing_id, suggestions[]}`)
+- `orphans` (array of IDs)
+- `scope` and `scan_dirs`
+
+### Exit code semantics
+
+- `0`: no broken references and no orphans.
+- `1`: at least one broken reference or orphan found.
+
+This matches the requirement for meaningful machine semantics and makes CI integration straightforward.
+
+### Relationship to `maintain` task 7 and `doctor`
+
+To avoid mental-model fragmentation:
+
+- `doctor`: quick environment and health snapshot.
+- `maintain`: orchestrated maintenance workflow bundle.
+- `link-check`: deep, focused graph diagnostic with complete output.
+
+Implementation recommendation: make `maintain` task 7 call the same internal diagnostic function used by `link-check`, then render a concise summary in maintain mode. This keeps one source of truth.
+
+## 3. `ontos rename` Design
+
+### Command interface
+
+```bash
+ontos rename <old_id> <new_id> [--apply] [--json] [--scope docs|library]
+```
+
+- Dry-run by default.
+- `--apply` executes writes (aligned with `scaffold` precedent from discovery reports).
+- `--json` emits structured change plan/result.
+- `--scope` uses same scope model as `link-check`; recommend `library` default for consistency.
+
+### Rename scope (what gets updated)
+
+Structured frontmatter fields:
+
+- `id` (target document)
+- `depends_on`
+- `impacts`
+- `describes`
+
+Body references:
+
+- Markdown links: `[text](target)` and reference-style equivalents where target resolves to the renamed ID.
+- Bare ID references (token-level match of `old_id` outside code spans/fences).
+
+Explicitly excluded:
+
+- File and directory moves (deferred to v3.3).
+- External URLs.
+
+### Body-link parser design (highest-risk component)
+
+v3.2.4 introduces a markdown-aware rewrite pass with conservative matching:
+
+1. Parse document into zones: normal text, fenced code blocks, inline code spans.
+2. Apply replacements only in normal-text zones.
+3. For markdown link targets, rewrite only when target is an internal reference that resolves to `old_id`.
+4. For bare IDs, replace only strict token matches (word-boundary-safe, no substring rewrites).
+
+This design directly addresses known corruption scenarios in discovery:
+
+- code fences containing YAML examples,
+- inline code snippets,
+- multi-`---` manuals/templates,
+- documents with frontmatter comments.
+
+### Atomicity model and failure handling
+
+Pre-validation (no writes):
+
+1. Verify `old_id` exists exactly once.
+2. Reject if `new_id` already exists (collision).
+3. Detect duplicate IDs in scanned corpus and abort (avoid silent overwrite behavior called out in feasibility).
+4. Require clean git working tree.
+5. Build full rewrite plan in memory (all target files, all replacements).
+
+Execution (`--apply`):
+
+- Use `SessionContext` buffered writes and commit flow.
+- Commit only after pre-validation and rewrite planning fully succeed.
+
+Known limitation from discovery: `SessionContext` does not guarantee rollback after partial Phase 2 rename failures. Mitigation in v3.2.4 is strict fail-fast pre-validation + clean git requirement so full revert is always available via git.
+
+### Collision detection and error handling
+
+Hard failures (non-apply and apply):
+
+- `old_id` not found
+- `old_id` ambiguous (duplicate IDs)
+- `new_id` already exists
+- parse/resolve error on any to-be-modified file
+- dirty git tree
+
+On failure, command prints actionable diagnostics and exits non-zero without partial planned changes being reported as applied.
+
+### Dry-run behavior and output
+
+Default dry-run prints:
+
+- whether rename is valid
+- list of files that would change
+- per-file change summary (`frontmatter_fields_changed`, `body_refs_changed`)
+- aggregate counts
+
+With `--json`, emit a full change plan (machine-consumable file list + counts + blockers).
+
+### Scan scope decision
+
+Use explicit library scope support because current command scans are inconsistent (`map`, `maintain`, `query`, `snapshot` differ, per feasibility report).
+
+Recommendation for v3.2.4 defaults:
+
+- `link-check`: default `library`
+- `rename`: default `library`
+
+Rationale: content report findings (broken links/orphans) are measured across `.ontos-internal/` and `docs/`; defaulting to narrower scope under-reports and under-fixes real issues.
+
+## 4. Risk Assessment
+
+### `ontos link-check`
+
+Primary risks:
+
+- Scope mismatch (user expects whole-library, command scans subset).
+- Confusing severity treatment across `depends_on` vs `impacts/describes`.
+
+Blast radius:
+
+- Low (read-only).
+
+Mitigations:
+
+- explicit `--scope`
+- explicit per-field reporting
+- stable exit codes
+- shared diagnostic core reused by maintain task 7
+
+### `ontos rename`
+
+Primary risks:
+
+- False positive/negative body replacements (parser quality).
+- Partial commit if filesystem failure occurs during Phase 2 of `SessionContext`.
+- ID collision/duplication causing incorrect target resolution.
+
+Blast radius:
+
+- High (cross-library writes).
+
+Mitigations:
+
+- dry-run default + `--apply`
+- clean-git precondition
+- full in-memory planning before write
+- strict collision/duplicate detection
+- post-apply report of every modified file
+
+### Frontmatter comment destruction risk
+
+Discovery confirms existing serialization strips YAML comments and normalizes order. This is not new in v3.2.4, but rename can trigger it on touched files.
+
+v3.2.4 position:
+
+- Accept as known constraint for this release, with explicit warning in command output/docs.
+- Minimize exposure by rewriting only files with real reference changes.
+- Preserve safe recovery via clean-git requirement and reviewable diffs.
+
+Deferred improvement (not in this proposal): comment-preserving frontmatter editing strategy.
+
+## 5. Open Questions
+
+### Q1. Should orphan-only findings trigger exit code `1`?
+
+Recommendation: **Yes**.
+
+Why: orphan prevalence is severe (40% in content report), and CI users need one integrity gate signal for both broken references and graph disconnection.
+
+### Q2. Should `link-check` include `impacts` and `describes` by default or only `depends_on`?
+
+Recommendation: **Include all three by default, with field-specific reporting**.
+
+Why: broken `impacts` are already non-trivial (13 broken edges) and are part of documented cross-reference fields in discovery.
+
+### Q3. Should rename rewrite markdown path targets when file paths do not change?
+
+Recommendation: **Rewrite only targets semantically resolving to `old_id`; do not perform path migration behavior**.
+
+Why: file moves are explicitly deferred, and over-aggressive path rewriting is a corruption risk.
+
+### Q4. Should v3.2.4 introduce one shared "library scanner" utility?
+
+Recommendation: **Yes, minimally**.
+
+Why: feasibility identified inconsistent scan behavior as a systemic risk; both new commands should share one scan contract to avoid divergent results.
+
+## 6. Dependencies & Constraints
+
+### Existing infrastructure this proposal builds on
+
+- CLI registration + options dataclass command pattern.
+- Graph and validation layers (`build_graph`, orphan detection, cross-reference validators).
+- Suggestion engine with confidence scores.
+- `SessionContext` two-phase write workflow.
+- Dry-run/`--apply` UX precedent from `scaffold`.
+
+### Architectural constraints
+
+- Two parsing paths exist (core fallback + IO YAML); command behavior must be consistent across both.
+- Duplicate IDs currently can be overwritten silently in some loaders; rename/link-check must detect and fail explicitly.
+- `SessionContext` is transactional but not a full rollback system after partial Phase 2 failures.
+- No external HTTP dependency model; URL checks remain out of scope.
+
+### Backward compatibility commitments (must not change)
+
+- No automatic source conversion to Obsidian wikilinks.
+- No standalone mass standardization rewrite in this release.
+- No schema expansion for non-existent `summary` field.
+- No file/directory move semantics in `rename`.
+- `link-check` remains read-only.
+
+---
+
+**Proposal outcome for review:** Approve v3.2.4 scope as two-command release (`link-check`, `rename`) with conservative write safety model and explicit deferral of retrofit variants.

+
+## Layer Violations
+
+### AUDIT-CC-01 — Core→IO Layer Violation in snapshot.py
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-01` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/core/snapshot.py:106-109`, `ontos/io/config.py`, `ontos/io/files.py`, `ontos/io/yaml.py` |
+| **Category** | Layer Violation |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Description** | `snapshot.py` is in `ontos/core/` but imports directly from `ontos/io` inside `create_snapshot()` (lines 107-109): `from ontos.io.config import load_project_config`, `from ontos.io.files import scan_documents, load_document_from_content`, `from ontos.io.yaml import parse_frontmatter_content`. Core modules should contain pure domain logic with no IO dependencies. Every other core module respects this boundary. |
+| **Risk** | Core layer becomes untestable without filesystem. Future refactoring (e.g., in-memory snapshots for testing) requires touching core. Sets precedent for other core modules to import IO. |
+| **Effort** | Medium |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-02 — Cross-Command Import Chain (agents → instruction_protocol → claude_template → export)
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-02` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/commands/agents.py:15-20`, `ontos/commands/claude_template.py:5-10`, `ontos/commands/export.py:12`, `ontos/commands/export_claude.py:11-14` |
+| **Category** | Layer Violation |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Description** | Four cross-command import dependencies beyond the known X-M7 `maintain.py` case: `agents.py` and `claude_template.py` both import from `instruction_protocol.py`; `export.py` and `export_claude.py` both import from `claude_template.py`. This creates a dependency chain: `export → claude_template → instruction_protocol ← agents`. Commands should be independently deployable. |
+| **Risk** | Changing `instruction_protocol.py` breaks agents, claude_template, and transitively export. Can't refactor template generation without touching 4 files. Circular dependency risk if instruction_protocol ever needs command context. |
+| **Effort** | Medium |
+
+---
+
+## Contract Inconsistencies
+
+### AUDIT-CC-03 — Two Frontmatter Parsers with Incompatible Error Contracts
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-03` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/core/frontmatter.py:23-76`, `ontos/io/yaml.py:77-107`, plus 10 callers in `ontos/commands/` |
+| **Category** | Contract Inconsistency |
+| **Severity** | P1 |
+| **Description** | `parse_frontmatter()` returns `None` on error (silent failure, lines 69-76). `parse_frontmatter_content()` raises `ValueError` on error (loud failure, lines 102-104). 10 command callers use `parse_frontmatter()` and must null-check; 3 callers use `parse_frontmatter_content()` and must try/catch. Callers handle the difference inconsistently: `maintain.py:478` uses `or {}` fallback, `query.py:41` doesn't check for None at all (but guards with `if fm` on line 42), `promote.py:170` wraps in try/except. A third parser variant `parse_frontmatter_yaml()` (yaml.py:45-74) exists and is exported but never called. The two active parsers also differ on edge cases: the fallback parser in `parse_frontmatter()` splits on first colon (truncating values with colons), while `parse_frontmatter_content()` uses PyYAML `safe_load`. |
+| **Risk** | Adding new commands requires knowing which parser to use and which error pattern to follow. No documentation explains the choice. v3.2.4 `rename` must pick one — wrong choice means silent skips or unexpected aborts on malformed files. |
+| **Effort** | Large |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-04 — Three Command Return Type Contracts
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-04` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/commands/map.py:668`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:653`, `ontos/commands/log.py:238`, `ontos/commands/hook.py:32`, `ontos/commands/doctor.py:527`, plus 10 other command files |
+| **Category** | Contract Inconsistency |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Description** | Command functions use three different return type contracts: (A) `int` — map, maintain, log, hook; (B) `Tuple[int, str]` — stub, migrate, init, verify, scaffold, agents, export, promote, query, consolidate; (C) `Tuple[int, DoctorResult]` — doctor. The CLI wrapper functions in `cli.py` handle this by special-casing each command, but new commands have no guidance on which contract to follow. |
+| **Risk** | Wrong return type for a new command causes runtime crash at CLI dispatch. The inconsistency makes the codebase harder to reason about — you have to read the CLI wrapper to know what each command returns. |
+| **Effort** | Medium |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-06 — Ubiquitous Defensive Enum Pattern (21 occurrences)
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-06` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/commands/map.py:171,186,375,376,450,498,541,542,633,634`, `ontos/commands/export_data.py:71,72,122,123`, `ontos/core/validation.py:140`, `ontos/core/migration.py:81,90`, `ontos/core/snapshot.py:44,55,69,75`, `ontos/core/graph.py:60` |
+| **Category** | Contract Inconsistency |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Description** | 21 occurrences of `doc.type.value if hasattr(doc.type, 'value') else str(doc.type)` across 6 files. This defensively handles cases where `doc.type` might be a string instead of a `DocumentType` enum. But `load_document_from_content()` (files.py:151-160) always creates a proper enum, falling back to `DocumentType.ATOM` on invalid values. The defensive check is obsolete — `doc.type` is always an enum by construction. Line 171 of map.py is the most paranoid: `d.type.value == "log" or str(d.type) == "log"` — checking both `.value` AND `str()`. |
+| **Risk** | Obscures the actual type contract. Developers copying this pattern in new code perpetuate the confusion. If the enum contract is ever intentionally broken, 21 locations silently adapt instead of failing fast. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-07 — Nine Different Scan Scopes Across Commands
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-07` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/commands/map.py:709-714`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:232-243`, `ontos/commands/query.py:31-37`, `ontos/commands/verify.py:35`, `ontos/commands/scaffold.py:54-60`, `ontos/commands/promote.py:162`, `ontos/commands/agents.py:154`, `ontos/commands/migrate.py:68`, `ontos/core/snapshot.py:115-127` |
+| **Category** | Contract Inconsistency |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Description** | `scan_documents()` is called from 9 locations with 5 different scope patterns: (1) `docs_dir + scan_paths` (map, maintain), (2) entire project root (query, verify), (3) docs + `.ontos-internal/strategy` only (agents), (4) docs + `.ontos-internal` (promote, snapshot), (5) user-provided dirs (migrate, scaffold). No shared constant or configuration defines "the library." Each command independently decides what to scan. |
+| **Risk** | Commands produce inconsistent results on the same library. `query` finds documents that `map` doesn't (because it scans root). `agents` misses documents in `.ontos-internal/reference/`. Adding new commands requires guessing which scope to use. The v3.2.4 proposal's `--scope library` flag would add a 6th scope definition. |
+| **Effort** | Medium |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-19 — Asymmetric Validation Severity for depends_on vs impacts/describes
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-19` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/core/graph.py:74-81`, `ontos/core/validation.py:155-169,171-178` |
+| **Category** | Contract Inconsistency |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Description** | Broken `depends_on` references produce severity `"error"` (graph.py:78). Broken `impacts` references produce severity `"warning"` (validation.py:162). Broken `describes` references produce severity `"warning"` (validation.py:48). All three are cross-document reference fields pointing to document IDs. The severity asymmetry is undocumented — no comment or design note explains why `impacts` and `describes` are less important than `depends_on`. `ValidationResult.add_error()` routes errors to `.errors` list and warnings to `.warnings` list, so broken impacts/describes are structurally separated from broken depends_on in all downstream consumers. |
+| **Risk** | Commands that check `result.errors` for broken references miss broken `impacts` and `describes`. The v3.2.4 `link-check` command inherits this asymmetry — "link-check finds no errors" could be true while 13 broken `impacts` references exist as hidden warnings. |
+| **Effort** | Small |

+## Duplication
+
+### AUDIT-CC-05 — Duplicate build_graph() with Different Signatures
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-05` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/core/graph.py:44-83`, `ontos/commands/query.py:58-69` |
+| **Category** | Duplication |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Description** | Two `build_graph()` functions with the same name but incompatible signatures. Core version: `build_graph(docs: Dict[str, DocumentData]) -> Tuple[DependencyGraph, List[ValidationError]]`. Query version: `build_graph(files_data: Dict[str, dict]) -> Tuple[Dict[str, List[str]], Dict[str, List[str]]]`. Different input types (DocumentData vs raw dict), different output types (DependencyGraph vs plain dicts). Only `query.py` uses its local version. |
+| **Risk** | Import confusion — a developer could import the wrong `build_graph`. The query version doesn't benefit from core graph improvements (validation, error collection, orphan detection). Divergent behavior over time. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-09 — Five Document Loading Patterns
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-09` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/commands/query.py:38-55`, `ontos/commands/map.py:731`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:248-256`, `ontos/commands/verify.py:93-107`, `ontos/commands/promote.py:120-136` |
+| **Category** | Duplication |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Description** | Five distinct patterns for loading documents from files: (1) `parse_frontmatter()` returning raw dict (query, scaffold, migrate, consolidate — 6 commands), (2) `parse_frontmatter()` + manual `normalize_depends_on()` call (query.py:48), (3) `load_document_from_content()` returning `DocumentData` objects (map, maintain — 2 commands), (4) manual `content.split('---', 2)` + body extraction (verify, promote — 2 commands), (5) `parse_frontmatter()` with `or {}` fallback (maintain.py:478). Pattern 1 callers get raw dicts without type normalization. Pattern 3 callers get typed `DocumentData` objects. This means query.py works with different data types than map.py for the same documents. |
+| **Risk** | New commands must choose a loading pattern with no guidance. Code that works with one pattern can't interoperate with another. The v3.2.4 rename command would need to choose a pattern, and its choice affects which documents it can process. |
+| **Effort** | Large |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-10 — Duplicate load_common_concepts() Definitions
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-10` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/core/frontmatter.py:199-239`, `ontos/core/suggestions.py:45-77` |
+| **Category** | Duplication |
+| **Severity** | P3 |
+| **Description** | Two functions named `load_common_concepts()` with different signatures. The frontmatter.py version reads from filesystem (`docs_dir` parameter), returns `set`. The suggestions.py version parses from context map content string, returns `Set[str]`. Only the suggestions.py version is actually called (from `log.py:127`). The frontmatter.py version is dead code. |
+| **Risk** | Developer imports the wrong one. Name collision makes it unclear which is canonical. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-11 — Duplicate normalize_depends_on Logic
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-11` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/core/frontmatter.py:154-171`, `ontos/io/files.py:166-178` |
+| **Category** | Duplication |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Description** | `normalize_depends_on()` in frontmatter.py handles None, string, and list inputs. `load_document_from_content()` in files.py (lines 166-178) duplicates the same logic inline: `if depends_on is None: depends_on = []`, `elif isinstance(depends_on, str): depends_on = [depends_on]`. Commands using pattern 1 loading (query.py:48) call the function. Commands using pattern 3 loading (map, maintain) use the inline logic. Both should converge on the function. |
+| **Risk** | Logic diverges — a fix to the function doesn't fix the inline code. The inline version doesn't handle all edge cases the function does (e.g., non-string list elements). |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+

+
+## Error Handling
+
+### AUDIT-CC-08 — SessionContext.commit() Exceptions Unhandled by 5 Callers
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-08` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/core/context.py:132-202`, `ontos/commands/scaffold.py:180`, `ontos/commands/promote.py:216,267`, `ontos/commands/verify.py:152,198,238`, `ontos/commands/stub.py:143`, `ontos/commands/consolidate.py:241` |
+| **Category** | Error Handling |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Description** | `SessionContext.commit()` can raise `RuntimeError` (lock acquisition failure, line 150) or `IOError` (write failure, re-raised at line 195). Five commands call `commit()` without try/except: scaffold (line 180), promote (lines 216, 267), verify (lines 152, 198, 238), stub (line 143), consolidate (line 241). These exceptions propagate to `cli.py:1052` which catches all `Exception` and returns exit code 5 with a generic "Internal error" message. Users see no actionable diagnostics. |
+| **Risk** | Lock contention or disk errors during commit produce unhelpful "Internal error: ..." messages. The user doesn't know if their files were partially modified, fully modified, or untouched. |
+| **Effort** | Small |

+## Dead Code
+
+### AUDIT-CC-12 — Dead Code: extract_doc_ids_from_text()
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-12` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/core/suggestions.py:152-169` |
+| **Category** | Dead Code |
+| **Severity** | P3 |
+| **Description** | `extract_doc_ids_from_text()` is defined, exported in `__init__.py`, but never called from any module or test. It extracts document IDs from freeform text using set intersection with known IDs. Possibly planned for body-link detection (relevant to v3.2.4 rename) but currently orphaned. |
+| **Risk** | Confusing for maintainers. May bitrot if kept. Could be mistakenly relied upon for v3.2.4 without verification. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-13 — Dead Code: parse_frontmatter_yaml()
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-13` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/io/yaml.py:45-74`, `ontos/io/__init__.py:8,45` |
+| **Category** | Dead Code |
+| **Severity** | P3 |
+| **Description** | Third frontmatter parser variant: `parse_frontmatter_yaml(content: str) -> Optional[Dict]`. Exported in `__init__.py` but never imported or called anywhere in the codebase. Returns `Optional[Dict]` (yet another error contract, distinct from both `parse_frontmatter()` and `parse_frontmatter_content()`). Appears to be a legacy intermediate between the other two parsers. |
+| **Risk** | Confuses the already-muddled parsing story (AUDIT-CC-03). A developer might use it by mistake. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-14 — Dead Code: DocumentCache Class
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-14` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/core/cache.py` (entire module) |
+| **Category** | Dead Code |
+| **Severity** | P3 |
+| **Description** | Complete `DocumentCache` class with hit rate tracking, stats, and TTL support. Never instantiated or imported anywhere in the codebase. Prepared infrastructure for an optimization that was never integrated. |
+| **Risk** | Maintenance burden. May give false impression that document caching is available. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-15 — Unused Configuration Options
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-15` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/core/config.py:70-71,80` |
+| **Category** | Dead Code |
+| **Severity** | P3 |
+| **Description** | Three config options defined in dataclasses but never enforced: `WorkflowConfig.enforce_archive_before_push` (line 70), `WorkflowConfig.require_source_in_logs` (line 71), `HooksConfig.strict` (line 80, referenced only in a comment in hook.py as a "future feature"). These options are parsed from `.ontos.toml` if present, consuming config budget without providing behavior. |
+| **Risk** | Users may set these options expecting enforcement. Silent no-ops erode trust in configuration. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-16 — validate_concepts() Never Called by ValidationOrchestrator
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-16` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/core/suggestions.py:127-149`, `ontos/core/validation.py:72-86` |
+| **Category** | Dead Code |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Description** | `validate_concepts()` exists in suggestions.py with a complete implementation (checks concepts against a known register). But `ValidationOrchestrator.validate_all()` (validation.py:72-86) calls `validate_graph()`, `validate_log_schema()`, `validate_impacts()`, and `validate_describes()` — but NOT `validate_concepts()`. The concepts field is never validated anywhere in the automated pipeline. |
+| **Risk** | Concepts with typos or stale references go undetected. Users assume validation is comprehensive when it silently skips concepts. Relevant to v3.2.4: if `link-check` claims to validate "all references," it inherits this gap. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-17 — OutputHandler Bypassed in 3 Commands
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-17` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/commands/doctor.py:516-524`, `ontos/commands/init.py:49-59`, `ontos/commands/log.py:1-225`, `ontos/ui/output.py:12-109` |
+| **Category** | Contract Inconsistency |
+| **Severity** | P3 |
+| **Description** | `OutputHandler` provides consistent emoji-prefixed output (`error()`, `warning()`, `success()`, `info()`) and respects a `quiet` flag. 7 commands use it properly. But `doctor.py` uses direct `print()` for config output (line 516-524), `init.py` uses direct `print()` for help text (lines 49-59), and `log.py` doesn't use `OutputHandler` at all (entire 225-line file). Additionally, `files.py:159` prints warnings to `sys.stderr` directly instead of using OutputHandler. |
+| **Risk** | `--quiet` flag doesn't suppress output from these commands. Output formatting is inconsistent (some messages get emoji, others don't). Piping output is unreliable. |
+| **Effort** | Medium |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-18 — dry_run Field Declared But Never Checked
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-18` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/commands/map.py:39`, `ontos/commands/log.py:47` |
+| **Category** | Dead Code |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Description** | `GenerateMapOptions.dry_run` (map.py:39) and `EndSessionOptions.dry_run` (log.py:47) are declared as `bool = False` in their options dataclasses. Neither file ever checks `options.dry_run` or `self.dry_run`. The fields are not wired to CLI argparse flags, so users can't pass `--dry-run` for these commands. But the dataclass fields suggest the feature was planned and forgotten. If a future developer wires the CLI flag, the option would be silently ignored since no code checks it. |
+| **Risk** | Misleading API — the options dataclass implies dry-run support exists. If the CLI flag gets wired without implementing the check, users get false confidence that dry-run is active. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+### AUDIT-CC-20 — Exported verify_document() Never Imported
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-CC-20` |
+| **Files** | `ontos/commands/__init__.py:145`, `ontos/commands/verify.py` |
+| **Category** | Dead Code |
+| **Severity** | P3 |
+| **Description** | `verify_document()` is exported from `ontos/commands/__init__.py` (line 145) but never imported by any module in the codebase. Only `verify_command()` is used. |
+| **Risk** | Minor — clutters the public API surface. |
+| **Effort** | Small |

+
+### Top 5 Priority Fixes
+
+1. **CC-03** (P1): Unify frontmatter parser contracts — single error model, one canonical parser
+2. **CC-07** (P2): Define shared scan scope constants — prerequisite for v3.2.4 `--scope` flag
+3. **CC-09** (P2): Consolidate document loading patterns — prerequisite for v3.2.4 `rename`
+4. **CC-06** (P2): Remove obsolete defensive enum checks — 21 locations, simple cleanup
+5. **CC-05** (P2): Deduplicate `build_graph()` — query.py should use core version
+
+### v3.2.4 Relevance
+
+Findings CC-03, CC-07, CC-09, CC-16, and CC-19 directly affect the v3.2.4 `link-check` and `rename` commands. These should be resolved before or during v3.2.4 implementation to avoid inheriting architectural debt into new commands.

+# Codebase Audit: UX Consistency & CLI Behavior Gaps
+
+**Auditor:** Gemini (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
+**Date:** 2026-02-10
+**Scope:** Project Ontos v3.2.3
+
+---
+
+## Executive Summary
+
+The Project Ontos CLI has evolved significantly, but it suffers from "interface drift" where individual commands have developed their own dialect for flags, status reporting, and JSON output. The most critical UX gaps are the **overloaded `-f` short flag**, **hallucinated features in the documentation**, and **broken JSON output contracts** in several core commands.
+
+---
+
+## Cross-Command Findings
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-1` |
+| **Command(s)** | `init`, `map`, `env`, `agents`, `export data`, `export claude`, `migration-report`, `migrate` |
+| **Category** | Flag Consistency |
+| **Severity** | P1 |
+| **Current behavior** | The `-f` short flag is overloaded with three different meanings: `--force` (in most commands), `--filter` (in `map`), and `--format` (in `env`). |
+| **Expected behavior** | Short flags should be globally consistent or at least avoid direct conflict for high-use operations. `-f` should almost certainly be reserved for `--force` given its prevalence. |
+| **Effort** | Small (Update `cli.py` registration) |
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-2` |
+| **Command(s)** | `log`, `promote`, `query`, `consolidate`, `verify` |
+| **Category** | Output Format |
+| **Severity** | P1 |
+| **Current behavior** | The `--json` flag is registered globally but ignored or partially broken in many commands. `OutputHandler` prints emojis and formatted text to stdout even when `--json` is requested, resulting in unparseable mixed output. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Commands must respect the `--json` flag by either suppressing all `OutputHandler` calls and emitting a final JSON result, or by using `JsonOutputHandler` for all structured communication. |
+| **Effort** | Large (Refactor `OutputHandler` or command-level handlers) |
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-3` |
+| **Command(s)** | `scaffold`, `maintain`, `consolidate`, `schema-migrate` |
+| **Category** | Flag Consistency |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Current behavior** | Inconsistent "Dry Run" UX. `maintain` uses `--dry-run, -n` (default OFF). `scaffold` uses `--apply` and `--dry-run` (default ON). `schema-migrate` uses `--dry-run, -n` and `--apply` as mutually exclusive required flags. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Unified pattern for destructive operations. Standard recommendation: `--dry-run` is the default for high-risk operations, with `-n` as a consistent alias. |
+| **Effort** | Medium (CLI registration + handler logic) |
+
+---
+
+## Command-Specific Findings
+
+### `map`
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-4` |
+| **Command(s)** | `map` |
+| **Category** | Help Text |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Current behavior** | `map --help` claims `--obsidian` enables "wikilinks, tags". Codebase inspection of `map.py` shows zero tag-related output logic; it only handles wikilink formatting. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Help text should accurately reflect implemented features. |
+| **Effort** | Small (Update `cli.py`) |
+
+### `log`
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-5` |
+| **Command(s)** | `log` |
+| **Category** | Doc Drift |
+| **Severity** | P1 |
+| **Current behavior** | `Ontos_Manual.md` documents `--enhance` and `--list-concepts` flags for `ontos log`. These flags do not exist in the CLI parser or the command handler. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Remove from documentation or implement the missing features. |
+| **Effort** | Small (Doc fix) |
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-6` |
+| **Command(s)** | `log` |
+| **Category** | Flag Consistency |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Current behavior** | `log` uses `--auto` to skip confirmation. `init` uses `--yes/-y`. `consolidate` uses `--all/-a`. `promote` uses `--all-ready`. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Use a consistent "non-interactive" flag like `--yes` or `--non-interactive` across all commands that prompt. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+### `doctor` & `maintain`
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-7` |
+| **Command(s)** | `doctor`, `maintain` |
+| **Category** | Output Format |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Current behavior** | `doctor` reports statuses as `[pass, fail, warn]`. `maintain` reports statuses as `[success, failed, skipped]`. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Unified status terminology for internal diagnostics and task runners. |
+| **Effort** | Medium |
+
+### `query`
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-8` |
+| **Command(s)** | `query` |
+| **Category** | Output Format |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Current behavior** | `query --health` produces a custom report with its own ASCII styling (`📊 Graph Health Report`) that ignores the global `--quiet` flag for its main report body. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Diagnostic reports should follow `OutputHandler` patterns and respect quiet/JSON flags. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+### `agents` & `export`
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-9` |
+| **Command(s)** | `agents`, `export claude` |
+| **Category** | Discoverability |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Current behavior** | `agents` generates `AGENTS.md` and `.cursorrules`. `export claude` (buried under `export` subcommands) generates `CLAUDE.md`. These are all "AI Agent instructions" but are split across unrelated command branches. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Consolidate agent instruction generation under a single command or clear hierarchy (e.g., `ontos agents --format claude`). |
+| **Effort** | Medium |
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-10` |
+| **Command(s)** | `agents` |
+| **Category** | Discoverability |
+| **Severity** | P3 |
+| **Current behavior** | `agents` has a hidden alias `agent-export`. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Deprecated aliases should be visible with a warning (like `export`) or removed if v3.0 cleanup is active. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+---
+
+## Documentation vs. Code Drift
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-11` |
+| **Command(s)** | All |
+| **Category** | Doc Drift |
+| **Severity** | P1 |
+| **Current behavior** | `Ontos_Manual.md` and various `README` files still use `python3 ontos.py [cmd]` in examples. The tool has been a native package since v3.0, and `ontos.py` does not exist in the root (it is `ontos/__main__.py`). |
+| **Expected behavior** | All documentation should use the `ontos [cmd]` syntax. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-12` |
+| **Command(s)** | `update` |
+| **Category** | Doc Drift |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Current behavior** | `Ontos_Manual.md` Section 10 lists `update` as a command. `cli.py` has no `update` command registered. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Implement `update` (for pip package updates) or remove from command list. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-13` |
+| **Command(s)** | `maintain` |
+| **Category** | Doc Drift |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Current behavior** | `Ontos_Manual.md` lists `Migrate` as task 1 of `maintain`. The code and `--help` call it `migrate_untagged`. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Align task names between documentation and CLI help. |
+| **Effort** | Small |
+
+---
+
+## Error Handling
+
+| Field | Content |
+|-------|---------|
+| **ID** | `AUDIT-G-14` |
+| **Command(s)** | All |
+| **Category** | Error Messages |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Current behavior** | CLI catch-all (`cli.py:1053`) prints `Error: [Exception Message]`. If an internal error occurs (like `KeyError` or `ImportError`), the user gets a cryptic python message without context. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Differentiate between `UserError` (bad flags/missing files) and `InternalError` (code bugs). Internal errors should suggest reporting a bug. |
+| **Effort** | Medium |
+
+---
+
+**Total Findings:** 14
+**P1 Severity:** 4
+**P2 Severity:** 9
+**P3 Severity:** 1
+
+**Report Concluded.**

+
+| # | Topic | Auditor A | Auditor B | Conflict Type | Resolution Recommendation |
+|---|-------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------------------|
+| 1 | **Dry-run / `--apply` inconsistency** | Gemini (`G-3`, P2): UX inconsistency across `scaffold`, `maintain`, `consolidate`, `schema-migrate` | Codex (`C-4`, P1): `scaffold --apply --dry-run` silently writes — mutual exclusion not enforced | Severity (P2 vs P1) + Scope (UX pattern vs correctness bug) | Codex is right that the _bug_ is P1 (data safety). Gemini is right that the _pattern_ is P2 (UX). Fix the bug first (C-4), then unify the pattern (G-3). |
+| 2 | **`--json` broken across commands** | Gemini (`G-2`, P1): `OutputHandler` emits mixed text+JSON | Codex (`C-2`, P1 / `C-3`, P2): `env` and `query` specifically ignore `--json` | Scope | Same root cause, different granularity. G-2 is the systemic view; C-2/C-3 are specific instances. Treat as one work item with C-2/C-3 as acceptance criteria for G-2. |
+| 3 | **`validate_concepts()` never called** | Claude Code (`CC-16`, P2): Dead code — never invoked by `ValidationOrchestrator` | Gemini: not flagged | No conflict, noting coverage | CC-16 stands. Gemini didn't audit validation internals. |
+| 4 | **Duplicate ID silent overwrite** | Codex (`C-8`, P1): Correctness bug — nondeterministic graph output | Claude Code (`CC-07`, P2 — scope inconsistency context): Noted as part of scan scope fragmentation | Severity (P1 vs P2 context) | Codex's P1 is correct — this is a correctness bug independent of scan scope. |
+| 5 | **Command import layering** | Claude Code (`CC-02`, P2): agents → instruction_protocol → claude_template → export chain | Backlog (`X-M7`, P3): "Re-evaluate command-to-command imports in `maintain.py`" | Scope + Severity | CC-02 is broader (4 commands, not just maintain). Subsumes X-M7. Use CC-02 as primary, retire X-M7. |
+| 6 | **`export claude` vs `agents` consolidation** | Gemini (`G-9`, P2): Consolidate under `agents --format claude` | Backlog (`X-M12`, P3): "Evaluate command-surface consolidation" | Severity (P2 vs P3) | Same item. Gemini provides the concrete recommendation. Use G-9 as primary. |

+## Merged Findings
+
+### P1 — Critical
+
+| # | IDs | Title | Category | Auditor(s) | Files | Effort |
+|---|-----|-------|----------|------------|-------|--------|
+| 1 | `CC-03` | **Two frontmatter parsers with incompatible error contracts** — `parse_frontmatter()` returns None (silent), `parse_frontmatter_content()` raises ValueError (loud). 10+ callers handle differently. Third parser variant `parse_frontmatter_yaml()` is dead code. | Contract Inconsistency | Claude Code | `core/frontmatter.py`, `io/yaml.py`, 10 command callers | Large |
+| 2 | `G-1` | **`-f` short flag overloaded** — means `--force` (most), `--filter` (map), `--format` (env) | Flag Consistency | Gemini | `cli.py` | Small |
+| 3 | ⚠️ `G-2`, `C-2`, `C-3` | **`--json` flag broken/ignored in multiple commands** — `OutputHandler` emits mixed text+JSON; `env` ignores global `--json`; `query` never branches on `json_output` | Output Format | Gemini (P1), Codex (P1, P2) | `cli.py`, `env.py`, `query.py`, `log.py`, `promote.py`, `consolidate.py`, `verify.py` | Large |
+| 4 | `G-5` | **Hallucinated `log` flags in manual** — `--enhance` and `--list-concepts` documented but don't exist | Doc Drift | Gemini | `Ontos_Manual.md` | Small |
+| 5 | `G-11` | **Documentation uses `python3 ontos.py`** — tool has been native package since v3.0 | Doc Drift | Gemini | `Ontos_Manual.md`, READMEs | Small |
+| 6 | `C-1` | **No-command exits 0** — missing command should be non-zero exit | Input Validation | Codex | `cli.py:1037-1043` | Small |
+| 7 | ⚠️ `C-4`, `G-3` | **`scaffold --apply --dry-run` silently writes** — mutual exclusion not enforced. Part of broader dry-run UX inconsistency (G-3, P2). | Input Validation | Codex (P1), Gemini (P2) | `cli.py:444-975` | Small (bug) / Medium (UX pattern) |
+| 8 | `C-5` | **`validate_describes_field()` crashes on list input** — assumes `describes` is scalar; list input throws `TypeError` | Edge Case | Codex | `validation.py:40-41` | Small |
+| 9 | `C-7` | **`depends_on`/`impacts` non-list values cause `TypeError`** — numeric/object values not normalized | Input Validation | Codex | `files.py:167-174`, `graph.py:64`, `validation.py:160` | Medium |
+| 10 | `C-8` | **Duplicate IDs silently overwritten** — `dict` assignment makes graph nondeterministic | Edge Case | Codex | `map.py:737`, `maintain.py:255`, `snapshot.py:152`, `query.py:44` | Medium |
+| 11 | `C-9` | **`_load_docs_for_graph()` silently skips parse failures** — swallows exceptions, under-reports broken links | Silent Failure | Codex | `maintain.py:251-258` | Small |
+| 12 | `C-10` | **`consolidate` moves files before ledger commit** — partial state on failure | Edge Case | Codex | `consolidate.py:230-240` | Medium |
+| 13 | `C-11` | **`consolidate` exits 0 on per-log errors** | Silent Failure | Codex | `consolidate.py:237-246` | Small |
+| 14 | `C-13` | **`doctor` uses `Path.cwd()` instead of repo root** — false failures from subdirectories | Edge Case | Codex | `doctor.py:216-290` | Medium |
+| 15 | `C-14` | **Path helpers anchored to package install, not project root** — commands target wrong filesystem tree | Edge Case | Codex | `paths.py:22-144` | Large |

+### P2 — Major
+
+| # | IDs | Title | Category | Auditor(s) | Files | Effort |
+|---|-----|-------|----------|------------|-------|--------|
+| 16 | ⚠️ `G-3` | **Dry-run UX inconsistency** — `maintain` (default OFF), `scaffold` (default ON), `schema-migrate` (mutually exclusive). See also P1 #7 (C-4). | Flag Consistency | Gemini | `scaffold.py`, `maintain.py`, `consolidate.py`, `schema-migrate` | Medium |

+| 18 | `G-6` | **Inconsistent confirmation-skip flags** — `--auto` (log), `--yes` (init), `--all` (consolidate), `--all-ready` (promote) | Flag Consistency | Gemini | Multiple commands | Small |
+| 19 | `G-7` | **Status terminology split** — `doctor` uses `[pass, fail, warn]`; `maintain` uses `[success, failed, skipped]` | Output Format | Gemini | `doctor.py`, `maintain.py` | Medium |

+
+### v3.2.4 Prerequisites
+
+These findings directly affect `link-check` and `rename` and should be resolved before or during v3.2.4:
+
+| # | ID(s) | Why |
+|---|-------|-----|
+| 1 | `CC-03` | `rename` must pick a parser — currently no canonical choice |
+| 38 | `CC-07` | `--scope` flag adds 6th scope definition to existing 5 |
+| 40 | `CC-09` | `rename` must pick a loading pattern — currently 5 options |
+| 42 | `CC-16` | `link-check` inherits the gap if it claims "all references validated" |
+| 44 | `CC-19` | `link-check` severity model inherits undocumented asymmetry |
+| 10 | `C-8` | Both commands build graphs on duplicate-vulnerable loaders |

+
+# v3.3 Release Plan
+
+## 1) Overview
+
+v3.3 ships **all 62 merged findings plus 3 pre-approved features**:
+- Unified scan scope (`--scope docs|library`) across commands
+- `ontos link-check`
+- `ontos rename <old_id> <new_id>`
+
+Because the scope is large and file overlap is high, this release is organized as **Track B (features)** plus **Track A hardening sub-tracks (A1-A4)**. This keeps each track independently verifiable while minimizing merge churn.
+
+Planning assumptions used:
+- No deferrals out of v3.3
+- Settled feature decisions are binding (`B1`-`B5`, `S1`, `S3`-`S5`)
+- Parallel execution only where there is no file overlap and no shared mutable dependency
+
+Estimated total change volume: **~3.8k-5.4k LOC** including tests/docs.
+
+---
+
+## 2) Track Structure
+
+### Track A1 — Core Contracts & Graph Integrity (Prereq Foundation)
+
+**Items:**
+`#1 (CC-03), #8 (C-5), #9 (C-7), #10 (C-8), #25 (C-6), #33 (CC-01), #36 (CC-05), #37 (CC-06), #40 (CC-09), #41 (CC-11), #42 (CC-16), #44 (CC-19)`
+
+**Why grouped:**
+- Shared core modules (`core/frontmatter.py`, `io/files.py`, `validation.py`, graph/load paths)
+- Resolves parser/loading contract ambiguity before any new feature code
+- Contains 4 of the 6 explicit Track B prerequisites (`#1`, `#10`, `#40`, `#42`, `#44`)
+
+**Aggregate effort:** ~0.7k-0.9k LOC
+
+**Dependencies:** none (must land first)
+
+---
+
+### Track B — Features (Unified Scan + Link-Check + Rename)
+
+**Features included:**
+1. Unified scan scope (`docs` default, `library` opt-in) across all relevant commands
+2. `ontos link-check` with shared body parser, JSON output, and exit codes `0/1/2`
+3. `ontos rename <old_id> <new_id>` with dry-run default, `--apply`, atomic commit path, targeted frontmatter updates
+
+**Merged findings absorbed in this track:**
+`#11 (C-9), #38 (CC-07)`
+
+**Why grouped:**
+- Single shared infrastructure: scanner + body-link parser (`B2`)
+- Feature coupling is intentional and already design-approved
+- `#38 (CC-07)` is resolved directly by unified scan; `#11 (C-9)` is resolved by replacing maintain-task link loading with shared scanner/reporting path
+
+**Aggregate effort:** ~1.6k-2.2k LOC
+
+**Dependencies:** Track A1
+
+---
+
+### Track A2 — Command Safety & State Integrity (Non-Feature Hardening)
+
+**Items:**
+`#12 (C-10), #13 (C-11), #14 (C-13), #15 (C-14), #26 (C-12), #27 (C-15), #28 (C-16), #29 (C-17), #45 (X-H2), #48 (X-M3), #51 (X-M10), #60 (X-M8), #61 (X-M9)`
+
+**Why grouped:**
+- Shared fix pattern: transactional safety, path-root correctness, strict input semantics
+- Primarily isolated to `consolidate`, `doctor`, `paths`, `migrate`, proposal/history parsing, config parsing
+- Minimal overlap with feature files
+
+**Aggregate effort:** ~0.5k-0.7k LOC
+
+**Dependencies:** Track A1
+
+---
+
+### Track A3 — CLI Surface, Output Contracts, and Command Taxonomy
+
+**Items:**
+`#2 (G-1), #3 (G-2/C-2/C-3), #6 (C-1), #7 (C-4/G-3), #16 (G-3), #17 (G-4), #18 (G-6), #19 (G-7), #20 (G-8), #21 (G-9/X-M12), #24 (G-14), #34 (CC-02/X-M7), #35 (CC-04), #39 (CC-08), #43 (CC-18), #46 (X-M1), #47 (X-M2), #49 (X-M4), #50 (X-M5), #52 (G-10), #58 (CC-17), #62 (X-M11)`
+
+**Why grouped:**
+- Heavy overlap in `cli.py` and command output/error pathways
+- Shared contract work: flags, JSON behavior, error classes, return-type normalization, command discoverability
+- Includes command-surface consolidation work (`G-9/X-M12`, `X-M11`)
+
+**Aggregate effort:** ~1.1k-1.5k LOC
+
+**Dependencies:** Track B + Track A2 (to avoid rework on command contracts changed in both)
+
+---
+
+### Track A4 — Docs Drift, Dead Code Removal, and Test Coverage
+
+**Items:**
+`#4 (G-5), #5 (G-11), #22 (G-12), #23 (G-13), #30 (C-18), #31 (C-19), #32 (C-20), #53 (CC-10), #54 (CC-12), #55 (CC-13), #56 (CC-14), #57 (CC-15), #59 (CC-20)`
+
+**Why grouped:**
+- Low-risk cleanup and test hardening
+- Documents and dead-code cleanup are independent from feature design decisions
+- Test additions are most stable after command contracts settle
+
+**Aggregate effort:** ~0.4k-0.6k LOC
+
+**Dependencies:**
+- Docs subset (`#4, #5, #22, #23`) can run anytime after Track B starts
+- Tests/dead-code subset should run after Track A3
+
+---
+
+## 3) Dependency Graph (Sequential vs Parallel)
+
+```text
+A1 (Core contracts)
+  ├──> B  (Features)
+  │      └──> A3 (CLI/output/taxonomy)
+  └──> A2 (Command safety)
+
+A4a (docs-only subset) can run in parallel with B/A2/A3.
+A4b (tests + dead code) runs after A3 for stable assertions.
+```
+
+Parallel-safe windows:
+- **Window 1:** `B` and `A2` in parallel (after `A1`)
+- **Window 2:** `A4a` parallel with any active code track
+
+Not parallel-safe:
+- `B` and `A3` (shared `cli.py`, `query.py`, command contracts)
+- `A2` and `A3` for final return/output harmonization passes
+
+---
+
+## 4) Track B Spec Readiness (Phase A)
+
+**Assessment:** Ready for Phase A spec writing.
+
+Why it is ready:
+- Discovery complete across three independent reports
+- Proposal + three reviews + consolidation complete
+- Blocking design questions are explicitly settled (`B1`-`B5`, `S1`, `S3`-`S5`)
+- Prerequisite risks are mapped into Track A1 and sequencing enforces them
+
+What Phase A spec should still concretize (not new design work):
+1. Command-by-command scan migration matrix (`--scope` adoption table)
+2. Final JSON schemas/examples for `link-check` and `rename` dry-run/apply
+3. Body-parser acceptance corpus (real IDs with dot/underscore/hyphen, code-fence and inline-code cases)
+4. Post-rename regeneration warning wording (`ontos map`, `ontos agents`)
+
+---
+
+## 5) Implementation Order Within Tracks
+
+### Track A1 Order
+1. Canonical parser/loader contract (`#1`, `#40`, `#41`)
+2. Input normalization and duplicate detection (`#25`, `#8`, `#9`, `#10`)
+3. Graph/validation contract cleanup (`#36`, `#37`, `#42`, `#44`)
+4. Layer boundary cleanup (`#33`)
+
+### Track B Order
+1. Unified scan utility + `--scope` wiring across target commands (`#38`, `B4`)
+2. Shared markdown body-link parser (zone-aware, tokenization per `B1`, read-only mode per `B2`, dry-run context per `B3`)
+3. `ontos link-check` (broken refs + duplicates + orphans, suggestions, JSON, `S1` exit semantics)
+4. `ontos rename` (dry-run default, `--apply`, collision checks, targeted FM update `S3`, canonical parser `S4`, post-run warning `S5`)
+5. Replace maintain task link check path with shared scanner/parser reporting (`#11`)
+
+### Track A2 Order
+1. Root/path correctness (`#15`, `#14`)
+2. Consolidate transactional semantics and strict input handling (`#12`, `#13`, `#26`, `#45`)
+3. Migration/proposal/history parser fixes (`#27`, `#28`, `#29`, `#48`)
+4. Config/template typing and status semantics (`#51`, `#60`, `#61`)
+
+### Track A3 Order
+1. Safety-critical correctness first (`#6`, `#7`, `#46`, `#47`, `#50`)
+2. JSON/output contract fixes (`#3`, `#20`, `#58`, `#35`, `#43`)
+3. Flag and command taxonomy normalization (`#2`, `#16`, `#17`, `#18`, `#19`, `#52`, `#21`, `#62`, `#34`)
+4. Error/exception handling and cycle-reporting closure (`#24`, `#39`, `#49`)
+
+### Track A4 Order
+1. Documentation drift fixes (`#4`, `#5`, `#22`, `#23`)
+2. Dead code and unused-option cleanup (`#53`, `#54`, `#55`, `#56`, `#57`, `#59`)
+3. Coverage gaps (`#30`, `#31`, `#32`)
+
+---
+
+## 6) Findings Resolved for Free by Track B
+
+- `#38 (CC-07)` is directly resolved by unified scan scope standardization.
+- `#11 (C-9)` is resolved if maintain's link-check task is routed through the shared scanner/parser and parse-failure accounting.
+
+No other findings should be marked "for free" without explicit acceptance tests; this avoids accidental under-delivery.
+
+---
+
+## 7) Delivery Risk Notes
+
+- The largest risk concentration is **Track B + Track A3** due shared command-surface files and output contracts.
+- If review bandwidth is limited, prioritize code review depth in this order: `A1 -> B -> A3 -> A2 -> A4`.
+- Expected PR strategy: one PR per track/sub-track with strict file-boundary discipline.

+
+## Cross-Check Matrix
+
+| # | ID | Item | Implemented? | Matches Spec? | Deviations / Notes |
+|---|---|---|---|---|---|
+| 1 | CC-03 | Canonical parser contract | Partial | No | Canonical parser/loader is broadly adopted (`ontos/io/files.py:155`, `ontos/io/yaml.py:60`, `ontos/core/frontmatter.py:29`), but `load_frontmatter()` still has a different error contract (only catches `OSError`, parse errors propagate) (`ontos/io/files.py:148`). Single-file callers may still surface inconsistent behavior (`ontos/commands/verify.py:224`). |
+| 8 | C-5 | `validate_describes_field()` list crash | Yes | Yes | List-safe validation is implemented (`ontos/core/validation.py:40`) and no longer crashes on list input. |
+| 9 | C-7 | `depends_on`/`impacts` non-list TypeError | Yes | Yes | Canonical normalization now handles scalar/list/object forms with warnings (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:155`, `ontos/io/files.py:312`). |
+| 10 | C-8 | Duplicate ID silent overwrite | Yes | Partial (acceptable) | Reusable duplicate detection is implemented in loader (`ontos/io/files.py:201`, `ontos/io/files.py:233`) and consumed by commands. Deviation: `query` fails on duplicates (`ontos/commands/query.py:165`) vs spec’s warn+continue policy. This is stricter than spec. |
+| 25 | C-6 | Enum coercion ValueError-only | Yes | Yes | Coercion path now handles ValueError/TypeError and records issues (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:234`, `ontos/core/frontmatter.py:266`, `ontos/io/files.py:300`). |
+| 33 | CC-01 | Core→IO layer violation | Yes | Yes | Runtime snapshot creation moved to IO layer (`ontos/io/snapshot.py:18`), and `ontos/core/snapshot.py` no longer imports IO. |
+| 36 | CC-05 | Duplicate `build_graph()` | Yes | Yes | Query-local graph builder removed; query uses core graph builder (`ontos/commands/query.py:11`, `ontos/commands/query.py:43`). |
+| 37 | CC-06 | 21 obsolete enum checks | Yes | Yes | Defensive enum checks are removed in target files; direct `.value` access is used (no remaining `hasattr(..., 'value')` matches). |
+| 40 | CC-09 | Five loading patterns | Yes | Yes | Canonical loading pattern is now used in key command flows (`map`, `maintain`, `query`, `verify`, `promote`) via `load_documents`/`load_frontmatter` and `parse_frontmatter_content`. |
+| 41 | CC-11 | Duplicate `normalize_depends_on` | Yes | Yes | Single source of truth established via `normalize_reference_list` + wrapper (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:155`, `ontos/core/frontmatter.py:197`) and adopted by loader (`ontos/io/files.py:312`). |
+| 42 | CC-16 | `validate_concepts()` never called | Partial | No | It is now called by orchestrator (`ontos/core/validation.py:105`) and includes structural checks. Gap: vocabulary check is incomplete; `known_concepts` is read but not applied (`ontos/core/validation.py:207`). Also `map` does not provide known concepts (`ontos/commands/map.py:64`). |
+| 44 | CC-19 | Asymmetric validation severity | Partial | No | Severity model is partially codified (`ontos/core/validation.py:31`, `ontos/core/graph.py:50`) and configurable for some paths. Gap: full field-level model from spec (`depends_on/impacts/describes/concepts` + rationale + uniform override plumbing) is not fully implemented; `impacts`/`describes` remain hardcoded warnings (`ontos/core/validation.py:194`, `ontos/core/validation.py:203`). |
+
+## Deviations
+
+1. **CC-03 (gap):**
+   - Spec: canonical parser contract with consistent caller error handling.
+   - Implemented: canonical path is in place, but single-file `load_frontmatter` parse error handling remains inconsistent.
+   - Assessment: **Gap**.
+
+2. **C-8 (acceptable improvement):**
+   - Spec: `query` warns+continues on duplicates.
+   - Implemented: `query` fails fast on duplicate IDs.
+   - Assessment: **Improvement over spec** (stricter correctness), but behavior differs from the specified policy table.
+
+3. **CC-16 (gap):**
+   - Spec: include structural checks plus optional vocabulary checks when `known_concepts` is available.
+   - Implemented: structural checks exist, vocabulary check path is not completed.
+   - Assessment: **Gap**.
+
+4. **CC-19 (gap):**
+   - Spec: explicit and configurable field-level severity model with rationale.
+   - Implemented: partial model; field-level consistency and override coverage are incomplete.
+   - Assessment: **Gap**.

+  - Current `maintain` behavior treats broken links as warning via severity override in `_task_check_links` (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:558`), so task returns success where test expects failure.
+
+Coverage observations vs A1 items:
+- Good direct coverage added for loader-contract and concept-structure behavior (`tests/test_document_loading_contract_a1.py`, `tests/test_validation_concepts_a1.py`).
+- No clear direct tests for duplicate-ID command policy matrix (#10) or full severity-asymmetry contract (#44).
+- Snapshot boundary tests are updated and passing (`tests/core/test_snapshot.py`, `tests/core/test_migration.py`).
+
+### Settled Decision Compliance (Quick Check)
+
+- **S4:** IO YAML parser is effectively canonical in runtime loading paths (`load_documents(..., parse_frontmatter_content)` across key commands). **Mostly compliant**, with remaining single-file error-contract inconsistency.
+- **B5:** Duplicate ID detection exists as reusable infrastructure in `DocumentLoadResult` and is used by multiple commands. **Compliant**.
+
+### Track B Readiness (Quick Check)
+
+- Foundation is much closer than prior pass, but still not fully solid for Track B due to open prerequisite gaps:
+  - `#1 (CC-03)` partial
+  - `#42 (CC-16)` partial
+  - `#44 (CC-19)` partial
+- `#10 (C-8)` groundwork is present and strong.
+
+## Gaps
+
+- Parser contract consistency is incomplete for single-file loading pathways.
+- Concept vocabulary validation pathway (`known_concepts`) is not fully wired.
+- Severity model is only partially aligned with the Track A1 spec’s explicit field-level contract.
+- One maintain test currently fails against the new severity behavior.
+
+## Issues for Review Board Attention
+
+1. **Track B prerequisite integrity:** confirm acceptable closure level for `#1`, `#42`, `#44` before green-lighting Track B.
+2. **Severity policy intent:** validate whether maintain/check-links should treat broken dependencies as warnings or failures.
+3. **Single-file parser error behavior:** verify whether current `load_frontmatter` contract is acceptable or needs harmonization with `load_documents`.
+4. **Vocabulary validation wiring:** confirm intended source and propagation of `known_concepts`.
+
+## Verdict
+
+**Return to Developer**
+
+The implementation is significantly improved and addresses most A1 items, but there are still foundational spec gaps in three prerequisite contracts (`#1`, `#42`, `#44`) plus an observable behavioral/test mismatch in maintain link-check severity.

+# v3.3 Track A1 Implementation Spec
+
+## 1. Overview
+
+Track A1 delivers the **core contract foundation** for v3.3:
+- canonical parsing/loading behavior
+- deterministic duplicate-ID handling
+- input normalization hardening at the IO boundary
+- explicit validation severity policy
+- elimination of graph-builder duplication
+- removal of one core-layer boundary violation (`core/snapshot.py -> io/*`)
+
+**Target version:** v3.3 (Track A1)
+
+**Risk level:** High (cross-cutting, multi-module contract changes)
+
+This track is release-critical because Track B (`--scope`, `link-check`, `rename`) depends directly on these contracts (prereqs: `#1`, `#10`, `#42`, `#44`).
+
+---
+
+## 2. Scope
+
+### In Scope (all 12 A1 items)
+
+- [ ] `#1 (CC-03)` Canonical parser contract and caller convergence
+- [ ] `#8 (C-5)` `validate_describes_field()` list-safe behavior
+- [ ] `#9 (C-7)` `depends_on`/`impacts` normalization for non-list input
+- [ ] `#10 (C-8)` Duplicate-ID detection without silent overwrite
+- [ ] `#25 (C-6)` Enum coercion catches `TypeError` + `ValueError`
+- [ ] `#33 (CC-01)` Remove core->io dependency in `core/snapshot.py`
+- [ ] `#36 (CC-05)` Remove duplicate `build_graph()` in `query.py`
+- [ ] `#37 (CC-06)` Replace 21 obsolete enum defensive checks
+- [ ] `#40 (CC-09)` Canonical document loading pattern for key commands
+- [ ] `#41 (CC-11)` Single source of truth for `depends_on` normalization
+- [ ] `#42 (CC-16)` Integrate concept validation into orchestrator
+- [ ] `#44 (CC-19)` Explicit validation severity model (documented + codified)
+
+### Out of Scope (explicitly not in Track A1)
+
+- Unified scan scope/`--scope` rollout (`Track B`)
+- New body-link parser (`Track B`)
+- New commands (`link-check`, `rename`) (`Track B`)
+- Command-surface UX harmonization (`Track A3`: flags/help/error UX)
+- Dead-code purge beyond what is required to satisfy A1 contracts (`Track A4`)
+
+---
+
+## 3. Dependencies
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+- None. This is the first track.
+
+### Blockers and Mitigations
+
+1. Blocker: Parser and loader changes touch many callers (`#1`, `#40`).
+   Mitigation: Introduce canonical loader APIs first; migrate callers in one pass; keep legacy `parse_frontmatter()` callable but marked internal-legacy.
+
+2. Blocker: Duplicate-ID policy affects command outcomes (`#10`).
+   Mitigation: Central duplicate detection in loader; command-level severity policy table (warn vs fail) implemented in each caller.
+
+3. Blocker: Snapshot refactor can break downstream imports (`#33`).
+   Mitigation: Move runtime snapshot assembly to IO layer and update all internal imports in same track; include compatibility note in release notes.
+
+---
+
+## 4. Technical Design
+
+Implementation order follows release plan:
+1. Canonical parser/loader contract (`#1`, `#40`, `#41`)
+2. Input normalization + duplicate detection (`#25`, `#8`, `#9`, `#10`)
+3. Graph/validation contract cleanup (`#36`, `#37`, `#42`, `#44`)
+4. Layer-boundary cleanup (`#33`)
+
+## 4.1 Parser/Loader Unification (`#1`, `#40`, `#41`, `#25`, `#9`)
+
+### Purpose
+
+Resolve the two-parser/five-loader ambiguity by defining one loading contract rooted in `io.yaml.parse_frontmatter_content()` (S4), then migrate key commands to that contract.
+
+### File Changes
+
+**Create**
+- `ontos/io/snapshot.py` (see 4.4; runtime loader wrapper)
+
+**Modify**
+- `ontos/io/files.py`
+- `ontos/core/frontmatter.py`
+- `ontos/io/yaml.py`
+- `ontos/commands/map.py`
+- `ontos/commands/maintain.py`
+- `ontos/commands/query.py`
+- `ontos/commands/verify.py`
+- `ontos/commands/promote.py`
+- `ontos/commands/scaffold.py`
+- `ontos/commands/migrate.py`
+- `ontos/commands/consolidate.py`
+
+### Canonical Loader Contract (new APIs in `ontos/io/files.py`)
+
+Add these dataclasses:
+
+```python
+@dataclass
+class DocumentLoadIssue:
+    code: str  # parse_error | duplicate_id | invalid_enum | invalid_reference_type
+    path: Path
+    message: str
+    doc_id: Optional[str] = None
+    field: Optional[str] = None
+    value: Optional[Any] = None
+
+@dataclass
+class DocumentLoadResult:
+    documents: Dict[str, DocumentData]
+    issues: List[DocumentLoadIssue]
+    duplicate_ids: Dict[str, List[Path]]  # sorted; first path is canonical kept doc
+```
+
+Add loader functions:
+
+```python
+def load_frontmatter(
+    path: Path,
+    frontmatter_parser: Callable[[str], Tuple[Dict[str, Any], str]],
+) -> Tuple[Optional[Dict[str, Any]], Optional[str]]
+
+
+def load_documents(
+    paths: List[Path],
+    frontmatter_parser: Callable[[str], Tuple[Dict[str, Any], str]],
+) -> DocumentLoadResult
+```
+
+Contract details:
+- Parser is always `parse_frontmatter_content` (S4).
+- Parse failure: file is skipped, issue recorded (`code="parse_error"`), processing continues.
+- No-frontmatter files are allowed by loader (they produce `DocumentData` via existing fallback behavior).
+- Duplicate IDs are detected once, centrally; never silently overwritten.
+- Determinism: paths processed in sorted order; first encountered ID is canonical.
+
+### Normalization Contract (`#41`, `#9`, `#25`)
+
+In `ontos/core/frontmatter.py`:
+- Add `normalize_reference_list(value, field_name, on_warning=None) -> List[str]`
+- Keep `normalize_depends_on()` as a wrapper delegating to `normalize_reference_list(..., field_name="depends_on")`.
+
+Normalization rules (`depends_on`, `impacts`):
+- `None` -> `[]`
+- `str` -> `[trimmed]` (empty string drops)
+- scalar (`int`, `float`, `bool`) -> `[str(value)]`
+- `list` -> each element normalized if scalar/string; invalid nested types dropped with warning
+- other container/object (`dict`, custom object) -> `[]` + warning
+
+In `ontos/io/files.py` `load_document_from_content()`:
+- Replace inline `depends_on`/`impacts` normalization with `normalize_reference_list`.
+- Enum coercion catches both `ValueError` and `TypeError` for `DocumentType` and `DocumentStatus` (`#25`).
+- Invalid enum/value conditions emit `DocumentLoadIssue(code="invalid_enum", ...)` instead of only printing to stderr.
+
+### Parser Convergence (`#1`)
+
+`parse_frontmatter_content()` remains canonical parser.
+
+`parse_frontmatter()` in `core/frontmatter.py` becomes **legacy-compatible only**:
+- keep callable for compatibility
+- update docstring to mark as non-canonical internal API
+- remove new internal command usage in A1 (all target callers move to loader APIs)
+
+`parse_frontmatter_yaml()` in `io/yaml.py`:
+- keep function for compatibility
+- reimplement as a thin wrapper using `parse_frontmatter_content()` semantics (no third contract)
+
+### Command Migration (`#40` + `#1` convergence)
+
+Migrate command internals to `load_documents`/`load_frontmatter`:
+
+1. `ontos/commands/map.py`
+- Replace per-file manual load loop (`docs[doc.id] = doc`) with `load_documents(...)`.
+- Preserve existing filter behavior (`matches_filter`) after load.
+
+2. `ontos/commands/maintain.py`
+- `_load_docs_for_graph()` uses `load_documents(...)` and returns both documents + issues.
+- `check_links` task must report parse issues (from loader) in task details/metrics.
+
+3. `ontos/commands/query.py`
+- Replace raw dict loading path with canonical `DocumentData` loading.
+- Keep existing query output semantics.
+
+4. `ontos/commands/verify.py`
+- `find_stale_documents_list()` loads documents through canonical loader path.
+- Single-file mode uses `load_frontmatter()` for consistent parse error messaging.
+
+5. `ontos/commands/promote.py`
+- file-scan phase uses canonical loader/frontmatter utility.
+
+Additional parser callers migrated for consistency (`#1`):
+- `ontos/commands/scaffold.py`
+- `ontos/commands/migrate.py`
+- `ontos/commands/consolidate.py`
+
+Implementation readiness check: **Yes**. Functions, call sites, and edge-case behavior are fully specified.
+
+---
+
+## 4.2 Graph Integrity (`#10`, `#36`, `#8`)
+
+### Purpose
+
+Make graph construction deterministic and safe for malformed references while eliminating query-specific graph drift.
+
+### File Changes
+
+**Modify**
+- `ontos/io/files.py`
+- `ontos/commands/map.py`
+- `ontos/commands/maintain.py`
+- `ontos/commands/query.py`
+- `ontos/core/validation.py`
+- `ontos/core/types.py`
+
+### Duplicate ID Handling (`#10`)
+
+Add `ValidationErrorType.DUPLICATE_ID` in `ontos/core/types.py`.
+
+Command policy table (context-dependent severity, as required by `#10` and Track B prereq `B5` groundwork):
+- `map`: treat duplicates as validation **errors** (exit 1)
+- `maintain` task `check_links`: treat duplicates as task **failed**
+- `query`: **warn** and continue with canonical kept doc
+- snapshot path (see 4.4): **warn** and continue with canonical kept doc
+
+Reporting requirements:
+- show duplicate ID
+- show all file paths participating in collision
+- never allow silent overwrite
+
+### Query Graph Builder Dedup (`#36`)
+
+In `ontos/commands/query.py`:
+- delete local `build_graph(files_data)` (lines flagged in audit)
+- import and use `ontos.core.graph.build_graph`
+- adapt dependent-by and health calculations to core graph/reverse_edges
+
+No parallel graph implementation remains after this change.
+
+### Describes List Safety (`#8`)
+
+In `ontos/core/validation.py`:
+- change `validate_describes_field()` from scalar-only logic to normalized list-aware logic
+- new accepted input forms:
+  - scalar string
+  - list of strings
+- invalid entries (non-string list members) generate warning-level schema validation errors, do not raise exceptions
+- return value becomes list of `ValidationError` instead of single optional error
+- update `ValidationOrchestrator.validate_describes()` accordingly
+
+Implementation readiness check: **Yes**. Behavior for duplicates and list handling is explicit and deterministic.
+
+---
+
+## 4.3 Validation Contract (`#42`, `#44`)
+
+### Purpose
+
+Make validation rules explicit and extensible so Track B can inherit them without hidden policy drift.
+
+### File Changes
+
+**Modify**
+- `ontos/core/validation.py`
+- `ontos/core/graph.py`
+- `ontos/commands/map.py`
+
+### Concepts Validation Integration (`#42`)
+
+In `ValidationOrchestrator.validate_all()` add `self.validate_concepts()`.
+
+New method behavior (`validate_concepts`):
+- reads `concepts` from each document frontmatter
+- normalization:
+  - missing field -> skip
+  - scalar string -> one concept
+  - list -> iterate
+- invalid concept forms (non-string, empty string) -> warning
+- duplicate concepts in one doc -> warning
+- vocabulary check:
+  - if `config["known_concepts"]` provided, unknown concepts -> warning
+  - if not provided, structural checks still run, vocabulary check is skipped
+
+`ontos/commands/map.py` must populate `known_concepts` when available (from project concept source) into validation config passed to `ValidationOrchestrator`.
+
+### Severity Model Codification (`#44`)
+
+In `ontos/core/validation.py` define constants:
+
+```python
+REFERENCE_SEVERITY_DEFAULT = {
+    "depends_on": "error",
+    "impacts": "warning",
+    "describes": "warning",
+    "concepts": "warning",
+}
+
+REFERENCE_SEVERITY_RATIONALE = {
+    "depends_on": "Structural graph edge; broken edge invalidates dependency graph.",
+    "impacts": "Informational lineage edge; should be fixed but not structural.",
+    "describes": "Staleness/coverage metadata; important but non-structural.",
+    "concepts": "Taxonomy metadata; non-structural.",
+}
+```
+
+Apply through a helper (config-overridable), e.g. `reference_severity_overrides` in validator config.
+
+In `ontos/core/graph.py`:
+- parameterize broken `depends_on` severity via optional argument (default from model above)
+- remove hard-coded severity literals in graph and validation paths
+
+This explicitly documents current asymmetry while making Track B free to override severities without duplicating logic.
+
+Implementation readiness check: **Yes**. Severity is now explicit, documented in code, and configurable.
+
+---
+
+## 4.4 Cleanup and Layer Boundary (`#37`, `#33`)
+
+### Purpose
+
+Remove legacy enum fallback debt and restore architecture boundary by eliminating IO imports from core snapshot.
+
+### File Changes
+
+**Create**
+- `ontos/io/snapshot.py`
+
+**Modify**
+- `ontos/core/snapshot.py`
+- `ontos/commands/export_data.py`
+- `ontos/commands/migration_report.py`
+- `ontos/core/migration.py`
+- `ontos/commands/map.py`
+- `ontos/commands/export_data.py`
+- `ontos/core/graph.py`
+- `ontos/core/validation.py`
+- tests that construct fake docs with raw strings
+
+### Remove Defensive Enum Checks (`#37`)
+
+Replace every occurrence of:
+- `doc.type.value if hasattr(doc.type, 'value') else str(doc.type)`
+- `doc.status.value if hasattr(doc.status, 'value') else str(doc.status)`
+
+with direct enum access:
+- `doc.type.value`
+- `doc.status.value`
+
+Known affected files (from audit):
+- `ontos/core/graph.py`
+- `ontos/core/migration.py`
+- `ontos/core/snapshot.py`
+- `ontos/core/validation.py`
+- `ontos/commands/export_data.py`
+- `ontos/commands/map.py`
+
+Test fixtures using string mocks must be migrated to `DocumentType`/`DocumentStatus` enums.
+
+### Snapshot Layer Refactor (`#33`)
+
+Current violation: `core/snapshot.py` imports `ontos.io.*` in runtime path.
+
+Refactor design:
+1. `ontos/core/snapshot.py` becomes pure domain module:
+- keep `SnapshotFilters`, `DocumentSnapshot`, `_matches_filter`
+- add pure constructor, e.g. `build_snapshot(...)` from already-loaded `DocumentData`
+- remove all `ontos.io.*` imports
+
+2. `ontos/io/snapshot.py` becomes runtime assembly layer:
+- loads config
+- scans files
+- loads documents using canonical `load_documents`
+- calls core snapshot constructor
+- returns `DocumentSnapshot`
+
+3. Update call sites:
+- `ontos/commands/export_data.py` import snapshot creation from IO layer
+- `ontos/commands/migration_report.py` same
+
+Compatibility note:
+- `ontos.core.snapshot.create_snapshot` is no longer runtime loader API in v3.3.
+- Internal imports must be updated in the same PR as the refactor.
+
+Implementation readiness check: **Yes**. Boundaries and call-site moves are explicit.

+
+## 5. Open Questions
+
+1. Should `map` treat duplicate IDs as hard errors (exit 1) or warnings (exit 0/2)?
+- Recommendation: **hard error (exit 1)**.
+- Why: context map is a graph artifact; duplicates make graph identity ambiguous and nondeterministic (`#10`, prerequisite `B5`).
+
+2. Should legacy `parse_frontmatter()` be removed now or left callable but deprecated?
+- Recommendation: **keep callable in v3.3, mark internal-legacy, remove internal command usage now**.
+- Why: enables low-risk migration while still enforcing canonical parser usage in runtime command paths (`#1`, S4).
+
+---
+
+## 6. Test Strategy
+
+## 6.1 New/Updated Tests by Item Group
+
+### Parser/Loader (`#1`, `#40`, `#41`, `#25`, `#9`)
+
+Add `tests/io/test_document_loading_contract.py`:
+- `load_documents` skips invalid YAML with `parse_error` issue
+- `load_documents` records duplicate IDs with all paths
+- enum coercion handles `TypeError` for list/dict `type`/`status`
+- `depends_on`/`impacts` normalization cases:
+  - scalar string
+  - scalar numeric
+  - dict object
+  - mixed list with invalid nested object
+
+Update command tests:
+- `tests/commands/test_maintain.py`
+  - `check_links` includes parse-skip details (no silent skip)
+- `tests/commands/test_query_parity.py`
+  - query still works with canonical loader path
+
+### Graph Integrity (`#10`, `#36`, `#8`)
+
+Add `tests/core/test_graph_contracts_a1.py`:
+- duplicate handling policy receives deterministic canonical ID path
+- `query` depended-by path uses core graph results (no local graph function)
+
+Add `tests/core/test_validation_describes_a1.py`:
+- `describes` as list no crash
+- list with unknown ID produces warnings
+- list with non-string element emits schema warning, no exception
+
+### Validation Contract (`#42`, `#44`)
+
+Add `tests/core/test_validation_concepts_a1.py`:
+- concepts structural validation (scalar/list/invalid entries)
+- duplicate concept warnings
+- unknown concepts warning when `known_concepts` provided
+
+Add `tests/core/test_validation_severity_policy_a1.py`:
+- default severity mapping is applied
+- override mapping changes emitted severity without code duplication
+
+### Cleanup (`#37`, `#33`)
+
+Update tests that use string doc mocks:
+- `tests/test_map_compact.py`
+- `tests/test_map_filter.py`
+
+Snapshot boundary tests:
+- update `tests/core/test_snapshot.py` and `tests/core/test_migration.py` to use IO snapshot entrypoint
+- add architecture test assertion that `ontos/core/snapshot.py` contains no `from ontos.io` imports
+
+## 6.2 Minimum Regression Suite for Track A1 PR Gate
+
+Run at minimum:
+
+```bash
+pytest \
+  tests/io/test_document_loading_contract.py \
+  tests/io/test_files_status_parsing.py \
+  tests/core/test_validation_describes_a1.py \
+  tests/core/test_validation_concepts_a1.py \
+  tests/core/test_validation_severity_policy_a1.py \
+  tests/core/test_snapshot.py \

+  tests/commands/test_maintain.py \
+  tests/commands/test_query_parity.py \
+  tests/test_map_compact.py \
+  tests/test_map_filter.py
+```
+
+---
+
+## 7. Migration / Compatibility
+
+### Backward-Compatible
+
+- CLI command names/flags unchanged in Track A1.
+- Core graph primitives remain same callable entry points (`build_graph`, `detect_cycles`, etc.), with additive optional severity plumbing.
+- `parse_frontmatter()` remains callable (legacy-compatible), but internal command code path should no longer rely on it.
+
+### Potentially Breaking (Python API/Internal Imports)
+
+- Snapshot runtime API moves out of `core/snapshot.py` into IO layer (`ontos/io/snapshot.py`).
+- Internal modules importing `create_snapshot` from core must be updated in-track.
+- Tests using raw-string type/status mocks must switch to enums due removal of defensive checks.
+
+### Deprecation Notes
+
+- `parse_frontmatter()` is deprecated for runtime command loading paths.
+- `parse_frontmatter_yaml()` remains compatibility shim; no new call sites should be added.
+
+---
+
+## 8. Risk Assessment
+
+### Overall Track Risk
+
+**High** due contract refactors touching IO boundary, graph construction, validation semantics, and one architecture boundary split.
+
+### Per-Item Risk
+
+- High: `#1`, `#40` (contract unification + caller migration)
+- Medium: `#10`, `#33`, `#44`
+- Low/Medium: `#8`, `#9`, `#25`, `#36`, `#37`, `#41`, `#42`
+
+### Mitigations
+
+1. Implement contract APIs first (`io/files.py`), then migrate callers.
+2. Keep deterministic duplicate policy (sorted paths, first-wins canonical) to avoid flaky behavior.
+3. Keep severity model configurable (default + overrides) to avoid hard-coding Track B policy prematurely.
+4. Land snapshot boundary refactor and all import updates in the same PR to avoid half-migrated state.
+5. Require focused regression suite above before merge.

+## 9. Item-to-Change Traceability
+
+| Item | Primary Files | Core Acceptance Condition |
+|---|---|---|
+| `#1 CC-03` | `core/frontmatter.py`, `io/yaml.py`, `io/files.py`, command callers | Canonical parser path used in runtime loading; no mixed parser contracts in key command paths |
+| `#8 C-5` | `core/validation.py` | `describes` list input never raises `TypeError` |
+| `#9 C-7` | `core/frontmatter.py`, `io/files.py` | `depends_on`/`impacts` always normalized to `List[str]` with warnings on invalid input |
+| `#10 C-8` | `io/files.py`, `map.py`, `maintain.py`, `query.py`, snapshot loader | Duplicate IDs are detected and reported; no silent overwrite |
+| `#25 C-6` | `io/files.py` | Enum coercion handles both `ValueError` and `TypeError` |
+| `#33 CC-01` | `core/snapshot.py`, `io/snapshot.py`, command imports | No IO imports remain in `core/snapshot.py` |
+| `#36 CC-05` | `commands/query.py` | Local query graph builder removed; core graph builder is only implementation |
+| `#37 CC-06` | 6 files listed in 4.4 | 21 defensive enum checks removed; direct enum access used |
+| `#40 CC-09` | `io/files.py`, `map.py`, `maintain.py`, `query.py`, `verify.py`, `promote.py` | Canonical loading contract is used by all 5 targeted command flows |
+| `#41 CC-11` | `core/frontmatter.py`, `io/files.py` | One normalization implementation used everywhere |
+| `#42 CC-16` | `core/validation.py` | Concepts validation executes via orchestrator |
+| `#44 CC-19` | `core/validation.py`, `core/graph.py` | Severity policy is explicit, documented, and configurable |

+# v3.2.3-final-merge-release-wrap
+
+## Summary
+
+Completed release wrap-up for v3.2.3 by merging the template parity work to `main`, deleting the feature branch, and confirming release publication status.
+
+## Goal
+
+Close the v3.2.3 implementation cycle cleanly with synchronized code, docs, backlog records, and release state.
+
+## Key Decisions
+
+- Kept patch scope strict: no CLI surface expansion in v3.2.3.
+- Recorded deferred review items in the v3.2 backlog for follow-up.
+- Preserved release continuity by merging into `main` via fast-forward.
+
+## Alternatives Considered
+
+- Completing deferred items in patch scope: rejected to avoid scope creep.
+- Holding merge until additional doc refinements: rejected in favor of explicit backlog capture.
+
+## Impacts
+
+- `main` now contains PR #66 implementation and cross-check follow-up docs.
+- Deferred work is visible and scheduled in `.ontos-internal/strategy/v3.2/v3_2_backlog.md`.
+- Team handoff is unblocked for next iteration planning.
+
+## Changes Made
+
+- Merged `feature/v3.2.3-template-parity` into `main` and pushed.
+- Deleted `feature/v3.2.3-template-parity` locally and on origin.
+- Archived cross-check and cleanup work in Ontos logs.
+- Updated v3.2 backlog with deferred PR #66 follow-up items.
+- Confirmed GitHub `v3.2.3` release is already published.
+
+## Testing
+
+- Verified clean git state on `main` after merge and branch deletion.
+- Verified release/tag presence via GitHub CLI (`v3.2.3` listed as latest).

+# v3.2.4 Discovery: Feasibility & Architecture Report
+
+## 1. Existing Infrastructure Map
+
+### 1.1 CLI command structure (entry points, parsing, registration)
+
+| Finding | Evidence |
+|---|---|
+| CLI entrypoint is `python -m ontos` -> `ontos.cli:main`. | `ontos/__main__.py` imports `main` and exits with it (`ontos/__main__.py:10-13`). |
+| Subcommands are registered centrally in `create_parser()` via `_register_*` functions. | `create_parser()` builds subparsers and registers commands (`ontos/cli.py:31-89`), with registrations such as `_register_map`, `_register_maintain`, `_register_query` (`ontos/cli.py:64-80`). |
+| Command handlers follow a stable pattern: build `*Options` dataclass, call `*_command`. | `_cmd_map` -> `MapOptions` -> `map_command` (`ontos/cli.py:549-565`), `_cmd_maintain` -> `MaintainOptions` -> `maintain_command` (`ontos/cli.py:614-627`), `_cmd_query` -> `QueryOptions` -> `query_command` (`ontos/cli.py:934-950`). |
+| Dispatch is generic: parsed `args.func(args)` with common exception handling. | `main()` parses args and routes to `args.func` (`ontos/cli.py:1013-1057`). |
+| Proposed commands are not currently first-class commands (`retrofit`, `rename`, `link-check`). | Current registered command set in parser/CLI tests does not include those names (`ontos/cli.py:64-80`, `tests/test_cli.py:67-70`, `tests/test_cli.py:146-148`). |
+
+### 1.2 Frontmatter parsing/writing and field-order behavior
+
+| Finding | Evidence |
+|---|---|
+| There are two parsing paths: `core.frontmatter.parse_frontmatter()` and IO YAML parser (`parse_frontmatter_content()`). | `parse_frontmatter()` in core (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:23-76`); IO parser contract in `parse_frontmatter_content()` (`ontos/io/yaml.py:77-107`). |
+| Fallback parser is intentionally shallow (line-by-line, inline lists only) and silently skips non-`key: value` lines. | `_fallback_yaml_parse()` skips lines without `:` (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:98-104`), supports inline list only (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:118-122`). |
+| YAML parsing uses `yaml.safe_load` in IO layer. | `parse_yaml()` uses `yaml.safe_load` (`ontos/io/yaml.py:10`, `ontos/io/yaml.py:14-30`). |
+| Validation checks required fields but not frontmatter key order. | `validate_frontmatter()` required-field checks only (`ontos/core/schema.py:255-292`). |
+| Serialization enforces an explicit field order. | `serialize_frontmatter()` defines `field_order` and emits ordered keys first (`ontos/core/schema.py:295-333`, especially `ontos/core/schema.py:315-319`). |
+| Existing write commands already rely on this serializer. | `scaffold` (`ontos/commands/scaffold.py:9`, `ontos/commands/scaffold.py:111-114`), `promote` (`ontos/commands/promote.py:8`, `ontos/commands/promote.py:136-139`), `stub` (`ontos/commands/stub.py:8`, `ontos/commands/stub.py:72-92`), `migrate` (`ontos/commands/migrate.py:7-11`, `ontos/commands/migrate.py:130-133`). |
+
+### 1.3 Cross-reference resolution (`depends_on`, links), graph model vs ad-hoc
+
+| Finding | Evidence |
+|---|---|
+| There is a core graph model (`DependencyGraph`) used for dependency integrity. | Model and edges/reverse edges in `DependencyGraph` (`ontos/core/graph.py:28-42`). |
+| Core `build_graph()` resolves only `depends_on` references and emits broken-link errors for missing IDs. | `build_graph()` loops `doc.depends_on` and checks against `existing_ids` (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`), emits `BROKEN_LINK` errors (`ontos/core/graph.py:74-83`). |
+| Validation orchestration uses that graph for broken links, cycles, orphans, depth. | `ValidationOrchestrator.validate_graph()` (`ontos/core/validation.py:88-133`). |
+| Additional cross-reference checks exist for `impacts` and `describes`, but not markdown body links. | `validate_impacts()` (`ontos/core/validation.py:155-169`), `validate_describes()` (`ontos/core/validation.py:171-178`). |
+| `query` has its own ad-hoc graph builder instead of reusing `ontos.core.graph`. | `query.build_graph()` uses local dict/defaultdict graph (`ontos/commands/query.py:58-69`). |
+| Existing maintain “link check” only checks broken `depends_on` via `build_graph()`. | `_task_check_links()` calls `build_graph(docs)` and reports `broken_links` count (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`). |
+
+### 1.4 What v3.1.0 Obsidian compatibility delivered vs assumptions
+
+| Finding | Evidence |
+|---|---|
+| v3.1 spec explicitly deferred retrofit/body-link conversion to v3.2.x. | Out-of-scope includes “Retrofit 314 existing documents” and “Wikilinks in document body” (`.ontos-internal/strategy/v3.1/V3.1.0-Obsidian-Compatibility-Spec.md:45-53`). |
+| Implemented runtime behavior is mostly map output formatting (`--obsidian` affects document link formatting). | CLI flag exists (`ontos/cli.py:121-123`); map document table uses `_format_doc_link(..., obsidian_mode)` (`ontos/commands/map.py:355-382`), formatter emits `[[...]]` (`ontos/commands/map.py:561-580`). |
+| Dependency tree output is not wikilink-formatted. | `_generate_dependency_tree()` prints plain IDs (`ontos/commands/map.py:415-441`). |
+| `tags`/`aliases` support exists as normalized load-time fields, not bulk retrofit writes. | `normalize_tags/normalize_aliases` (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:242-302`), used during load (`ontos/io/files.py:139-165`). |
+| Obsidian tests validate link formatting + lenient read, not bulk transformation. | `tests/commands/test_map_obsidian.py:3-55`. |
+| `map --obsidian` help text mentions tags, but map generation code has no `tags`/`aliases` output path. | Help string says “wikilinks, tags” (`ontos/cli.py:121-123`), no tags/aliases handling in map table/tree generation (`ontos/commands/map.py:355-382`, `ontos/commands/map.py:415-441`, `ontos/commands/map.py:561-580`). |
+
+### 1.5 Document enumeration (“walk the library”) utilities
+
+| Finding | Evidence |
+|---|---|
+| Shared walker exists: `scan_documents(dirs, skip_patterns)`. | `ontos/io/files.py:60-90`. |
+| `map` scans `docs_dir + scan_paths` from config (not root by default). | `scan_dirs = [docs_dir] + scan_paths` (`ontos/commands/map.py:709-714`). |
+| `maintain` uses the same docs+scan_paths model. | `_scan_dirs()` and `_scan_docs()` (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:232-243`). |
+| `query` scans from root by default (broader and different behavior). | `scan_documents([root], ...)` (`ontos/commands/query.py:31-37`), default `search_dir = root` (`ontos/commands/query.py:185-188`). |
+| `snapshot`/migration tooling explicitly scans both `docs/` and `.ontos-internal/`. | `create_snapshot()` scan dirs (`ontos/core/snapshot.py:115-127`). |
+| Default config has empty `scan_paths`, so command coverage depends heavily on command choice/config. | `scan_paths` default empty (`ontos/core/config.py:51-57`), project `.ontos.toml` omits `scan_paths` (`.ontos.toml:10-12`). |
+
+## 2. Feasibility Assessment per Feature
+
+### 2.1 `ontos retrofit` (by mode)
+
+| Mode | Reuse candidates | New code needed (scope) | Hardest part | Dependency risks | Blast radius |
+|---|---|---|---|---|---|
+| `--standardize` | `scan_documents` walker (`ontos/io/files.py:60-90`), parser+serializer (`ontos/io/yaml.py:77-107`, `ontos/core/schema.py:295-333`), transactional writes (`ontos/core/context.py:95-203`), existing rewrite precedent in migrate/scaffold/promote (`ontos/commands/migrate.py:123-142`, `ontos/commands/scaffold.py:111-114`, `ontos/commands/promote.py:136-139`). | Mostly orchestration CLI + rewrite loop + dry-run/report. **Medium** (~150-300 LOC). | Avoiding parse drift across parser paths (`parse_frontmatter` vs `parse_frontmatter_content`) and preserving body safely (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:23-76`, `ontos/io/yaml.py:77-107`). | Low-to-medium if implemented as command-layer utility; touching parser core increases risk. | Medium: mass frontmatter rewrite; generally recoverable via git, but broad diff churn. |
+| `--lint-fix` | Existing lint thresholds/rules are discoverable (`ontos/commands/map.py:493-520`), and rewrite pipeline exists (`ontos/core/schema.py:295-333`, `ontos/core/context.py:95-203`). | Need pruning policy, deterministic concept selection, summary generation policy, and opt-outs. **Medium-Large** (~250-500 LOC). | “Fill missing summary” is underspecified because `summary` is not a schema/ontology field and existing summary extraction is inconsistent/log-centric (`ontos/core/schema.py:38-58`, `ontos/core/ontology.py:104-176`, `ontos/commands/consolidate.py:73-88`, `ontos/core/history.py:105-120`). | Medium-high: adding new implicit metadata rules can conflict with curation workflows. | High: writes many docs; semantic corruption risk if auto-prune/summary heuristics are wrong. |
+| `--obsidian` | Existing pieces: tag/alias normalization (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:242-302`, `ontos/io/files.py:162-165`), wikilink format helper (`ontos/commands/map.py:561-580`), lenient reader (`ontos/io/obsidian.py:10-36`). | Needs full content-link rewrite engine, reversible migration metadata, collision handling, and bulk write orchestration. **Large** (500+ LOC). | Body link conversion has no existing parser/rewrite infrastructure; current graph/link logic is frontmatter-centric (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`, `ontos/core/validation.py:88-133`). | High: likely touches parsing/writing and command orchestration across many modules. | Very high: body/link corruption across library if rewrite rules are imperfect. |
+
+### 2.2 `ontos rename <old_id> <new_id>`
+
+| Question | Assessment |
+|---|---|
+| Reuse candidates | Graph + missing-ref logic (`ontos/core/graph.py:44-83`), library walkers (`ontos/io/files.py:60-90`, `ontos/commands/map.py:709-714`, `ontos/core/snapshot.py:115-127`), transactional writes/moves (`ontos/core/context.py:119-203`), report generation precedent (`ontos/commands/migration_report.py:27-127`, `ontos/commands/migration_report.py:160-199`). |
+| New code needed (scope) | Cross-reference indexer/rewrite engine for `depends_on`, `impacts`, `describes`, and any body-link formats; collision and idempotency checks; dry-run report; optional move logic. **Large** (500+ LOC). |
+| Hardest part | Safe global rewrite without false positives plus ID-collision prevention. Current loaders overwrite duplicate IDs silently (`docs[doc.id] = doc`) in map/maintain/query pipelines (`ontos/commands/map.py:736-738`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:250-256`, `ontos/commands/query.py:43-45`). |
+| Dependency risks | High if parser/graph contracts are expanded to include body links; medium if kept command-local with clear adapters. |
+| Blast radius | Very high: incorrect rename can break graph integrity and historical references across many files; partial failures are hard to unwind automatically. |
+
+### 2.3 `ontos link-check`
+
+| Question | Assessment |
+|---|---|
+| Reuse candidates | Existing `check_links` task (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`), graph broken-link detection (`ontos/core/graph.py:44-83`), orphan detection helper (`ontos/core/graph.py:129-145`), validation orchestrator (`ontos/core/validation.py:72-133`). |
+| New code needed (scope) | New CLI command wrapper + output modes + broader checks (orphans, possibly impacts/describes). **Small-Medium** (~120-250 LOC) for internal refs only. |
+| Hardest part | Defining scope of “link” because existing implementation checks `depends_on` only (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:562-567`). |
+| Dependency risks | Low if read-only and built on existing graph/validation paths; medium if expanded to body-link parsing or external URL checks. |
+| Blast radius | Low (diagnostic/read-only). |
+
+## 3. The Scoping Question
+
+### 3.1 Which command has most existing infrastructure (lowest effort)?
+
+`ontos link-check` has the strongest base: a working task already exists (`_task_check_links`) and uses the core graph validator (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`, `ontos/core/graph.py:44-83`). Turning this into a standalone CLI command is mostly interface work, not new core behavior (`ontos/cli.py:31-89`, `ontos/cli.py:96-190`).
+
+### 3.2 Highest risk-to-value ratio
+
+Highest risk-to-value: `ontos retrofit --obsidian`.
+
+Reasoning:
+- v3.1 explicitly deferred retrofit/body wikilinks (`.ontos-internal/strategy/v3.1/V3.1.0-Obsidian-Compatibility-Spec.md:45-53`).
+- Current implemented obsidian support is output-formatting oriented, not content transformation (`ontos/commands/map.py:355-382`, `ontos/commands/map.py:561-580`).
+- Existing link integrity infrastructure does not parse body links (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`, `ontos/core/validation.py:88-133`).
+
+### 3.3 If shipping exactly ONE command in v3.2.4
+
+Ship `ontos link-check` first.
+
+Why:
+- Reuses existing code directly.
+- Read-only (low blast radius).
+- Creates immediate value for graph hygiene before any write-heavy automation.
+- Can later serve as guardrail for rename/retrofit rollouts.
+
+Evidence: existing check-links task and graph validators (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`, `ontos/core/graph.py:44-83`, `ontos/core/validation.py:88-133`).
+
+### 3.4 Prerequisites among commands
+
+| Dependency | Assessment |
+|---|---|
+| `link-check` prerequisite for others? | Not technically required, but operationally valuable as a pre/post validation gate for rename/retrofit. Existing read-only checks already exist (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`). |
+| `rename` prerequisite for `retrofit`? | No hard dependency. They share a missing prerequisite: a robust global reference index/rewrite engine and consistent scan scope (`ontos/commands/map.py:709-714`, `ontos/commands/query.py:31-37`, `ontos/core/snapshot.py:115-127`). |
+| Shared prerequisite | Unifying “what is the library” scan behavior and reference coverage is more important than command ordering (`ontos/core/config.py:51-57`, `.ontos.toml:10-12`, `ontos/commands/map.py:709-714`, `ontos/commands/query.py:185-188`). |
+
+## 4. Architecture Concerns
+
+### 4.1 Do these commands require core graph/data-layer changes?
+
+| Command | Core change needed? | Evidence-based rationale |
+|---|---|---|
+| `link-check` | Probably no (for v1 scope). | Existing core graph already detects broken `depends_on` and orphans (`ontos/core/graph.py:44-83`, `ontos/core/graph.py:129-145`). |
+| `rename` | Likely yes if true “all references” includes body links. | Current core graph models `depends_on` edges only (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`), and command ecosystems use mixed parsers/scope (`ontos/core/frontmatter.py:23-76`, `ontos/io/yaml.py:77-107`, `ontos/commands/map.py:709-714`, `ontos/commands/query.py:31-37`). |
+| `retrofit` | `--standardize`: no core changes; `--lint-fix` and `--obsidian`: likely policy/data-model extensions. | No formal `summary` field in schema/ontology (`ontos/core/schema.py:38-58`, `ontos/core/ontology.py:104-176`); obsidian body conversion has no existing core representation. |
+
+### 4.2 Existing patterns/constraints that should guide implementation
+
+| Pattern/constraint | Evidence |
+|---|---|
+| Keep IO/parsing dependencies out of `core` where possible. | YAML wrapper explicitly isolates PyYAML in IO layer (`ontos/io/yaml.py:1-8`). |
+| Commands are thin wrappers around options dataclasses and command modules. | CLI handler pattern (`ontos/cli.py:549-627`, `ontos/cli.py:934-950`). |
+| Batch write operations should prefer `SessionContext` buffering/commit. | `SessionContext` write/move buffer and commit (`ontos/core/context.py:95-203`), used by migrate/scaffold/promote/stub (`ontos/commands/migrate.py:109-142`, `ontos/commands/scaffold.py:152-181`, `ontos/commands/promote.py:202-217`, `ontos/commands/stub.py:141-144`). |
+| Dry-run/report UX already exists and should be reused for risky commands. | `maintain --dry-run` (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:35-39`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:270-272`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:555-557`), `migrate --dry-run` (`ontos/commands/migrate.py:21-24`, `ontos/commands/migrate.py:118-121`), report generation command (`ontos/commands/migration_report.py:160-199`). |
+
+### 4.3 Potential boundary violations
+
+| Risk | Why it violates current boundaries |
+|---|---|
+| Putting body-link parsing heuristics into core graph immediately | Core graph currently models typed dependency edges from structured frontmatter, not freeform markdown parsing (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`). |
+| Adding network URL health checks into `doctor`/`link-check` without clear isolation | Current dependency set has no HTTP client dependency (`pyproject.toml:29-32`), and doctor currently performs local diagnostics only (`ontos/commands/doctor.py:51-565`). |
+| Treating “atomic rename” as solved by existing transaction helper | `SessionContext` supports move/write buffering, but failure handling does not provide full rollback for already-applied renames/writes (`ontos/core/context.py:159-203`). |
+
+## 5. What the Proposal Gets Wrong (or Doesn’t Know)
+
+1. The proposal assumes retrofit-level Obsidian transformation is close at hand; code reality is narrower.
+Evidence: v3.1 explicitly deferred retrofit/body wikilinks (`.ontos-internal/strategy/v3.1/V3.1.0-Obsidian-Compatibility-Spec.md:45-53`), while implementation mainly covers map link formatting and load-time tag/alias normalization (`ontos/commands/map.py:355-382`, `ontos/commands/map.py:561-580`, `ontos/io/files.py:162-165`).
+
+2. “`map --obsidian` includes tags” is overstated in current runtime behavior.
+Evidence: CLI help says “wikilinks, tags” (`ontos/cli.py:121-123`), but map rendering code only changes link formatting in the table and does not emit tag columns/sections (`ontos/commands/map.py:355-382`, `ontos/commands/map.py:561-580`).
+
+3. “Atomic rename across entire library” is underspecified against inconsistent scan scope and parser paths.
+Evidence: map/maintain use `docs_dir + scan_paths` (`ontos/commands/map.py:709-714`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:232-243`), query scans root (`ontos/commands/query.py:31-37`), snapshot scans docs + `.ontos-internal` (`ontos/core/snapshot.py:115-127`), default `scan_paths` is empty (`ontos/core/config.py:51-57`).
+
+4. ID-collision behavior is not addressed, but current pipelines silently overwrite same-ID docs in memory.
+Evidence: map (`ontos/commands/map.py:736-738`), maintain graph load (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:250-256`), query scan (`ontos/commands/query.py:43-45`).
+
+5. The proposal treats “summary fill” as straightforward, but `summary` is not part of canonical schema/ontology.
+Evidence: schema optional fields exclude `summary` (`ontos/core/schema.py:38-58`), ontology field definitions do not include `summary` (`ontos/core/ontology.py:104-176`). Existing summary extraction behavior is ad-hoc and inconsistent (`ontos/commands/consolidate.py:73-88`, `ontos/core/history.py:105-120`, `ontos/commands/map.py:185-190`).
+
+6. “link-check” is partially already implemented under `maintain`.
+Evidence: existing `check_links` task reports broken dependency links (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`), with tests validating that behavior (`tests/commands/test_maintain.py:203-217`).
+
+7. External URL health checks are not an incremental extension of current link checking; they introduce new concerns.
+Evidence: current link checking is dependency-ID based (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`, `ontos/commands/maintain.py:562-567`), and project deps do not include HTTP clients (`pyproject.toml:29-32`).
+
+8. The proposal underestimates legacy-content safety risks during bulk rewrite.
+Evidence: parser behavior is mixed (strict IO YAML vs fallback parser) (`ontos/io/yaml.py:77-107`, `ontos/core/frontmatter.py:79-151`), and not all commands use lenient Obsidian read path (`ontos/io/obsidian.py:10-36`, `ontos/commands/migrate.py:114-117`, `ontos/commands/promote.py:121-137`).
+
+## Recommendation Snapshot
+
+- **Ship in v3.2.4:** `ontos link-check` (standalone command, read-only), because `check_links` already exists and is read-only over graph data (`ontos/commands/maintain.py:549-578`, `ontos/core/graph.py:44-83`).
+- **Defer:** `retrofit --obsidian` and full `rename` until reference indexing/rewrite engine + dry-run/report + collision policy are designed (`ontos/core/graph.py:57-66`, `ontos/commands/migration_report.py:160-199`, `ontos/commands/map.py:736-738`).
+- **Safe next increment:** add `--orphans` and optional `--include impacts,describes` to `link-check` by reusing `ValidationOrchestrator`/`detect_orphans` (`ontos/core/graph.py:129-145`, `ontos/core/validation.py:155-178`).

+| **Category** | Test Gap |
+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Current behavior** | No direct tests for core graph primitives (`build_graph`, cycle/orphan/depth). Failures can propagate into multiple commands undetected. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Add direct unit tests for malformed dependency types, self-deps, empty graphs, and duplicate-node behavior. |

+| **Severity** | P2 |
+| **Current behavior** | No direct tests for schema parse/compatibility/serialization functions. Behavior around unknown schemas and serialization edge cases is unguarded. |
+| **Expected behavior** | Add focused tests for version parsing, unknown schema policy, and serialization round-trip edge cases. |
