# Testing Gemini

Questions and areas where Gemini's help would be valuable for Project Ontos.

## 1. Performance Optimization
- How can we improve the context map generation speed for large repositories (1000+ documents)?
- What caching strategies would work best for the `resolve_config()` function?

## 2. Testing Strategies
- What additional edge cases should we test for session appending with branch collisions?
- How should we test the `--enhance` workflow end-to-end?

## 3. Documentation Improvements
- Is the current mode system explanation clear enough for new users?
- What diagrams would help explain the session appending model?

## 4. Future Features (v2.5+)
- How could we implement a `--show` config debug command effectively?
- What would a semantic search across the ontology look like?
- Integration ideas with IDE extensions?

## 5. Architecture Questions
- Should `ontos_lib.py` be split into multiple modules as it grows?
- What's the best way to handle backward compatibility for config changes?
