# External review remediation: implemented 9-point v3.3.0 review response across 3 phases — quick wins (SECURITY.md, README roadmap, classifier bump, manual update, CHANGELOG cross-ref, agents regen), link-check false positive hotfix (408→92 via 4 filters in _looks_like_doc_id), and lower priority items (minimal example files, legacy test isolation). PR #76.
