# v3.3.1 — "Review Remediation"

**Release date:** 2026-02-28

Patch release shipping the full external review remediation cycle: link-check false positive reduction (408 → 45), documentation refresh, and a new `promote_check` maintenance task.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- **link-check FP reduction: 408 → 45** — Two rounds of pre-classification filters eliminate 89% of false positives from the generic body-reference scanner without compromising known-ID detection.
- **`promote_check` maintenance task** — `ontos maintain` now includes a 9th task that non-interactively reports documents ready for promotion from L0/L1 to L2.
- **External review remediation** — 8 of 9 adversarial review findings addressed, plus documentation and example refresh.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### link-check False Positive Reduction (PRs [#76](https://github.com/ohjonathan/Project-Ontos/pull/76), [#77](https://github.com/ohjonathan/Project-Ontos/pull/77))

Root cause: `_looks_like_doc_id()` accepted any token with digits/dots/underscores. In generic scan mode, this flagged bare list numbers, version strings, YAML field names, and filenames as "broken references."

**Round 1 filters (PR #76):**

| Filter | Pattern | Rejects |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Bare numbers | `^\d{1,3}$` | `1`, `42`, `100` |
| Version strings | `^v?\d+(\.\d+)+$` | `v3.2`, `3.2.1` |
| Known field names | Frozenset (14 entries) | `depends_on`, `status`, etc. |
| File extensions | 20 common extensions | `AGENTS.md`, `config.toml` |

**Round 2 filters (PR #77):**

| Filter | Pattern | Rejects |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Short labels | `^[A-Z]{1,2}-?[A-Z]?\d{1,2}$` | `A1`, `NB-1`, `L0`, `X-H1` |
| ALL_CAPS | `^[A-Z][A-Z_]+[A-Z]$` | `AUTO_CONSOLIDATE` |
| Version wildcards | `^v?\d+(\.\d+)*\.x$` | `v2.x`, `v3.2.x` |
| Pre-release versions | `^v?\d+(\.\d+)+[a-z]?$` | `v3.2.1b` |

**Result:** `broken_references` dropped from **408 → 92 → 45** across two rounds.

All filters affect only Pass 2 (generic unknown-ID scan). Pass 1 (known-ID exact match) is unaffected — references to existing documents are never missed.
