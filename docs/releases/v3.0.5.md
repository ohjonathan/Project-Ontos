## What's Changed

Quality-of-life release focused on `ontos init` UX improvements, license change, and tech debt cleanup.

### Features

- **feat(init): Add hook consent prompt with `--yes` flag** — `ontos init` now asks for explicit consent before installing git hooks, with `--yes` for non-interactive use. Improves the first-run experience for new users.
- **fix(init): Improve cleanup on abort** — If `ontos init` is interrupted, partial state is cleaned up properly instead of leaving orphaned config files.

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(mcp): Add FutureWarning for placeholder module** — The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server module now emits a clear FutureWarning instead of silently failing.
- **fix(version): Sync legacy `ONTOS_VERSION` to 3.0.5** — Legacy scripts now report the correct version.
- **fix: Remove license classifier per PEP 639** — Resolved PyPI packaging warning about deprecated license classifiers.

### License

- **Changed from Proprietary to Apache-2.0** — Ontos is now fully open source under the Apache 2.0 license.

### Documentation

- Updated README roadmap to v3.0.5 and fixed table of contents anchors.
- Added v3.0.5 fix summary and organized review documents.
- PyPI documentation links corrected.

### Testing

- Added hook confirmation flow tests and init cleanup tests.
- Enhanced test coverage for the `ontos init` wizard.
