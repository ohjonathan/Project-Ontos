## What's Changed

Patch release fixing critical CLI wrapper issues that prevented `ontos` commands from working correctly after `pip install`.

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(cli): Use CWD instead of package path for subprocess env** — CLI wrapper commands were resolving paths relative to the installed package instead of the user's working directory, causing `ontos map`, `ontos log`, and other wrapper commands to fail when run from the project root.
- **fix(cli): Resolve import shadowing in wrapper commands** — Fixed an import conflict where the `ontos` package namespace collided with legacy script imports during subprocess dispatch.
- **chore: Sync `pyproject.toml` version with `__init__.py`** — Version string was out of sync between the two sources of truth, causing `ontos version` to report incorrect values.

### Testing

- Added regression test for CLI wrapper CWD fix to prevent recurrence.

### Documentation

- Added v3.0.4 proposal documents (spec review, code review, and Chief Architect response).
- Updated context map.
