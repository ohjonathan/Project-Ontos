## Ontos v3.2.1

Patch release focused on stability, context-map correctness, and activation resilience.

### Highlights
- External review remediation from PR #61.
- Key Documents output aligned to spec with safer path formatting from PR #62.
- Config-driven, mode-aware Critical Paths in Tier 1 from PR #63.
- Activation resilience improvements after context compaction from PR #64.
- Proposal/doc organization and release hygiene updates from PR #65.

### Added
- `AGENTS.md` Trigger Phrases section and post-compaction recovery guidance.
- `docs/assets/` visuals used by the README.
- Proposal governance docs:
  - `.ontos-internal/strategy/proposals/README.md`
  - `.ontos-internal/tmp/README.md`

### Fixed
- Absolute-path leakage in context map output for Key Documents/Tier tables.
- Critical Paths hardcoded path behavior; now config-driven and contributor-mode aware.
- `.cursorrules` transform now preserves activation-resilience sections.
- CLAUDE template drift by centralizing the shared template source.
- Proposal folder naming typo corrected (`v3.2.1d`), plus deterministic thumbnail generation.

### Changed
- Proposal files reorganized for the v3.2.1 a/b/c/d tracks.
- Additional review and verification artifacts archived under `.ontos-internal/strategy/proposals/v3.2.1a/`.
